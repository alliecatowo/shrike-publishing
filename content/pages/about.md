storyContent: |
  Shrike Tabletop makes tabletop roleplaying games (RPGs) about combat and cooperation. Our games Era of Silence and Blood Neon are love letters to traditional game design!

  Founded in 2020 as a Baltimore-based storytelling studio, Shrike Publishing emerged from a passion for creating meaningful gaming experiences that challenge players and spark imagination. What started as a small indie project has grown into a dedicated team committed to pushing the boundaries of tabletop gaming.

  Our name, inspired by the shrike bird known for its cunning hunting techniques, reflects our approach to game design: strategic, intelligent, and always one step ahead. We believe that great games are not just about rules and components, but about the stories they tell and the experiences they create across tabletop games, written fiction, and other media.
