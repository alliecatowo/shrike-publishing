# Tabletop Gaming Trends for 2024

As we kick off 2024, the tabletop gaming industry continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Here are the trends we're watching closely:

## Hybrid Digital-Physical Games

More publishers are embracing hybrid models that combine physical components with digital enhancements. QR codes linking to companion apps, digital rule clarifications, and online community features are becoming standard.

## Sustainable Production

Eco-conscious gamers are driving demand for sustainably produced games. We're seeing more recycled materials, minimal plastic use, and carbon-neutral shipping options.

## Inclusive Design

Accessibility features like large-print cards, audio descriptions, and simplified rule sets are no longer nice-to-have features - they're essential for reaching broader audiences.

## Community-Led Content

The rise of platforms like Kickstarter and Patreon has enabled creators to develop games based on direct community feedback, leading to more innovative and player-driven designs.

## At Shrike Publishing

We're embracing these trends in our upcoming releases. *Era of Silence* includes digital companion content, and all our games now feature accessibility options. We're also working on community-suggested expansions for *Blood Neon*.
