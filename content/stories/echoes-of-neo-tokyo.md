## Excerpt

The rain-slicked streets of Neo-Tokyo pulsed with artificial life. Holographic advertisements flickered overhead, promising immortality through cybernetic enhancement and escape through virtual realities. Jax pulled his coat tighter, the neural implant at the base of his skull itching with unspent data.

"They're coming for you, Ghost," the message had said. No sender ID, just raw code that bypassed all his firewalls.

He'd thought the Ares Corporation job was clean - just another data theft. But now, with corporate drones patrolling every alley and bounty hunters crowding the nets, Jax knew he'd stumbled into something big.

Too big.
