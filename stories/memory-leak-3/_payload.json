I was pleased with such a good omen. We packed up as soon as it was light enough to see without extra lights. ",[143,172,173],{},"We were getting close now, this was the run. I consulted the map Birdie had given me carefully. We geared up. ",[143,175,176],{},"Arina took the backpack-sized communications relay. She had become the on-ground tech of our operation.  The rest of us took receivers. She activated Dotty and had it fly upwards as far as it could go in control range. She grabbed a rifle and sat on her tablet while the rest of us got ready.",[143,178,179],{},"Temperance had a bag full of different explosives and solvents. A small sack of cremation capsules too. If all went according to plan, we wouldn’t need to burn anyone. They insisted, nonetheless. They clutched another rifle. ",[143,181,182],{},"For Dorian, it was a pistol, a set of knives, and not much else. Though their enchanter’s gauntlet could do almost anything they needed it to. His was an impressively ornate construction. Like something an old-world knight would have worn, but covered in modern runework. ",[143,184,185],{},"Two-handed weapons were no good for me, but I had other options. I pressed a button on the side of my arm and two beams popped out of the metalwork. I fashioned a piece of flexible steel cable between the edges of it, loaded a bolt, and fired it into a purple cactus. Full impact, nearly went clean through. Temperance laughed and cheered. I smirked. For good measure, I also kept a blade in a hidden compartment in my leg. Finally, I grabbed a pistol from our arsenal. Just in case.",[143,187,188],{},"After an hour we had all finished prep. I looked at Arina. “What you got, A?” ",[143,190,191],{},"“Compound in sight. Walled and sealed from the top like we expected. I count two guards at the front gate. Couldn’t get close enough to get a count of the inside. Ravine a quarter of a mile away. Probably where drainage is.”",[143,193,194],{},"“I’m so glad I’m not going with you.” Dorian was putting a blue worker’s jumpsuit over his clothes. ",[143,196,197],{},"I craned my neck towards him, “Good point.

Do you need any bundling?”",[143,211,212],{},"“It’s better this way.”",[143,214,215],{},"I nodded, and looked at the other two. “Well girls, let’s get moving.” One last glance at Dorian, “Divine Will be with you.”",[143,217,218],{},"“Yeah sure, whatever.”",[143,220,221],{},"***** ",[143,223,224],{},"The three of us started to make our way towards our entry point. Dorian would hold back until we made sufficient progress, then make his way toward his side. I tensed up, but there was something of a thrill in all this. Back in the saddle. Everything was on the line. It was time to prove I wasn’t just a common merc.",[143,226,227],{},"I took us through a petrified forest for cover. There was something so beautiful about trees standing so resolute, centuries after they had died. I broke a branch off of one that fell and used it as a walking stick. I looked around. As I suspected, the patrols seemed to stay closer to the estate. ",[143,229,230],{},"In the ravine was a sealed grate, sure enough. I stopped the other two. It was being guarded by another spore drone. An off-green slimy one. Also floating. I waited to see what its route was. It wasn’t leaving. I ditched the stick and loaded a bolt outfitted with copper wiring and a battery, aimed, and fired. ",[143,232,233],{},"A hit. The drone’s mechanics were pierced and it caught aflame. It plummeted to the ground. The stench of burning fungus was sickening, even through the rebreathers. ",[143,235,236],{},"The smell of the drainage leaking from the grate out into the ravine was worse. I pulled on it hoping for an easy break. No luck. Kanra’Las wasn’t fucking around with security. ",[143,238,239],{},"Temperance set down their bag and pulled out a vial of yellow-orange liquid. “Ah, it’s nothing. I have this, just stand back.” Arina and I both obeyed. The yasre applied a few drops of the liquid to several points across the grate’s surface. The solution hissed and bubbled, and it was like watching centuries of wear and tear happen in real-time. Strong metal turned to rust, and Temperance gave it a good yank. It ripped a hole into it. The displaced bars rattled on the dusty ground. All of us could fit inside. They beamed, “I thought about putting ‘door-making specialist’ on business cards once.” They gave the ‘after you’ gesture with their arms. I went first. ",[143,241,242],{},"Climbing into any kind of active sewage system was one of the least pleasant things any person could experience. We kept our rebreathers on but the smell of mortal waste of all sorts fought against our filters. Arina wretched a few times, and I was worried she was going to throw up into her mask. Our clothes and environmental gear would need triple sanitation when we were done. ",[143,244,245],{},"I followed Birdie’s map faithfully. These underworks were shared by a few local installations. A right turn would have taken us to a colonial processing center for KAS Extraction, a left too soon or too late would take us to another drainage output on the other side of the plains. I found the correct turn and we wound our way towards the estate.",[143,247,248],{},"We found our access ladder. The sewage was less present but wafted down the hall toward us. I thumbed my communicator. “Hey D, we’re in position. What’s your status? Praise.”",[143,250,251],{},"*****",[143,253,254],{},"“V, almost to the delivery entrance. Keeping my mic hot.” Dorian sauntered up the side road to the delivery entrance at a steady pace. He knew the inhabitants were aware of his presence, and he wasn’t going to give them anything to be worried about.",[143,256,257],{},"“...Are you done talking? Praise.” Vulture’s voice was a bit too high, no control over resonance. Needed more vocal training. Maybe he just found her annoying.",[143,259,260],{},"He stopped and sighed. “Yes, I’m done.”",[143,262,263],{},"“You’re supposed to say praise or praise be if you’re completely done. Praise.”",[143,265,266],{},"Dorian rolled his eyes and made an obscene gesture that no one but the resograph cameras could see. These fucking losers. “Yes I’m almost there, I’m keeping the mic hot. I didn’t think I needed to tag my statement. Praise be, or whatever.”",[143,268,269],{},"He made his way up to the entrance. A single metal door next to a large cargo shutter. There was an intercom and a blood lock. If they had been professionals about this, they would’ve gotten the means to open the lock. They didn’t, so he pressed the buzzer. He waited and internally recited the character profile he’d established. ",[143,271,272],{},"A woman’s voice came over the door’s speaker, “This is private property, state your business.”",[143,274,275],{},"He adopted an accent like something he’d heard in the southwest, “G’Evening ma’am. This is New Millennium Enchantment and Repair. We got a service request and they sent me out.”",[143,277,278],{},"“We didn’t call for an enchanter.”",[143,280,281],{},"“Well sure y’all did! Why else would they send me out here? I got the order right here in my hands” he waved a clipboard to the resograph watching him. “Says right here ya need us to fortify the enchantments on the ebonsteel support beams in this fancy wall ya got here!” ",[143,283,284],{},"“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m going to need you to leave before I have to call security.” ",[143,286,287],{},"Good. Dorian only played games he knew he was going to win. Having them come to him, or having them let him in, the same outcome. Still, he was enjoying the sport of it. ",[143,289,290],{},"“Well, golly ma’am. I don’t know if my boss would like it if I went all the way back without the job being done! I don’t think your boss would like it much either if the magic failed and, merciful Council forbid, a part of the wall goes down. You’d be dealing with open-air exposure, wild critters, marauders-”",[143,292,293],{},"“-Okay okay. I’ll call the security chief and they’ll come meet you.”",[143,295,296],{},"Dorian grinned. Victory. “Glad to be of service, ma’am. I promise I’ll be faster than a crawler through mud!” He turned off his mic.",[143,298,251],{},[143,300,301],{},"I looked at the others. “Crawler in mud. That’s our signal!” We gathered up our things. Rebreathers on, though more for anonymity than breathing safety. I began to climb up the ladder, then Arina, then Temperance.",[143,303,304],{},"We reached the hatch. I pushed it open and slid out onto the pavement. When we were all up we closed the hatch. The whole place was surprisingly bright. Sterile white light panels had been installed at the base of the wall, and more hung from the metal framework of the glass roof. We were behind a shed. I peeked around the side. A lush green meditation garden, marked with a spiral pattern of stones toward the center. Birdie’s interior map was accurate. I would have to ask her how she sourced it. Temperance peeked out from behind me. “Rather pretty,” they observed. ",[143,306,307],{},"I ducked back behind the shed. “Artificial. Did you see anyone?”",[143,309,310],{},"“2 guards, a custodian, and it looks like a busser from their kitchen.”",[143,312,313],{},"“Guardhouse should be to our right… follow me.”",[143,315,316],{},"We ducked left into the shrubs that bordered the garden. Not too far from it was a pool cleaned by a tread-mobile drone. It paid us no mind. Arina rereleased Dotty and had it fly into an exposed vent. When a guard wandered too close to us, she had it start blaring noises through its loudspeakers. They ran towards the vent, and we slipped past toward another shed. Close to the villa itself now.",[143,318,319],{},"One sentry between us and the front door. We could go around back but that would be close to where Dorian was distracting the security chief. The sentry stood in place. Fuck. I felt Temperance’s long talons on my shoulder. They gave me that kind of diagonal head bob that’s meant to say ‘I got this.’ ",[143,321,251],{},[143,323,324],{},"Temperance stood back. Spellwork wasn’t their forte, or they would have pursued becoming a full-fledged mage. They took a long breath and closed their eyes. They focused on chanting. Drawing on this kind of power took a mix of concentration and the right set of invocations.",[143,326,327],{},"Something beyond themself began to push at their mind. The Barrier that all spellcasters must pass. They focused harder and imagined themselves pushing a pin through that Barrier. Power began to seep out, and they grabbed it.",[143,329,330],{},"Magic manifested into the Threads of reality. Either modifying them or creating new ones. They focused on the Threads and felt their natural resonance flow around them. The energy flowed into their hands, which began to pulse and glow. Soon, their whole body was enveloped in the shimmering field. ",[143,332,333],{},"Neither Vulture nor Arina could focus on them. Cloaking spells didn’t turn the caster truly invisible but rather bent the Threads around them so that looking at them directly became impossible. ",[143,335,336],{},"“Can you all see me?” They made a couple of rude gestures and stuck out their tongue. Vulture and Arina shook their heads and averted their gaze out of discomfort. “Good, then grab onto my shoulders!”",[143,338,339],{},"The other two complied, though with a bit of extra effort. Soon the shimmering field spread around us as well. Vulture tried to look at Temperance. No luck, like butter sliding on a hot pan. The group turned and started walking. Making a wide U shape around the sentry with their back turned to them. At one point he started turning his head in their direction, but it was like he couldn’t completely. He didn’t seem to mind.",[143,341,342],{},"They made it to the grand natural birchwood double doors. Alice grabbed a doorknob and stared at the metalwork. It looked like Restoration Age craftsmanship. Rich bastard. Vulture tried it. Unlocked. Dumb bastard. It opened inward. She looked inside for any immediate sentries. She made a motion to Temperance and Arina, and let go of the priest’s arm.",[143,344,345],{},"It was an open floorplan, very modern. Contrasted by centuries-old decor. Paintings of nobles, and a couple of landscapes. Even some Parathan era swag, like a grand blue vase that had been apparently reassembled with bronze.  Temperance looked at Vulture, and saw in her eyes the hungry look of a scavver who was staring at one of the biggest hauls of her life. Then a shake of the head and her focus was back on the job. Temperance appreciated Vulture more than other would-be crew leaders. She had good priorities. This was too clean to risk with extra loot. That was the safe play. Though, maybe if the team got some extra time…",[143,347,251],{},[143,349,350],{},"I made my way toward the far end of the room, where the sole occupant was dusting some shelves. The custodian had his back to me. It was as if the gods had ordained this run.  I kept low, to avoid being seen through the wide windows. Temperance held back and Arina was messing with the tablet. I closed the distance quickly. I opened my arms to grab him. ",[143,352,353],{},"He started turning around. ",[143,355,356],{},"Fuck. Impulse took over, I swung my metal arm in a punch. It connected with his skull and he tumbled back into the wall. He slumped, and blood started to trickle down the side of his head. ",[143,358,359],{},"The other two ran up. “Holy shit,” Temperance said, mirroring my thoughts. I held out my hand to Arina, “The mirror you have. Now.” She passed it. Temperance held up his head. I held it under his nose. Still breathing. That was going to need some treatment though. At least-",[143,361,362],{},"A rifle’s hammer clicked. ",[143,364,365],{},"I looked over my shoulder. Arina was holding a gun to a woman in a nightgown. Our intel said his wife was supposed to be in Sidersberg. His wife who was a human… This is an elek… younger too… Ah. I stepped forward and tried to reassure her. She shriveled at the sight of blood on my hands. “Please don’t scream.” An empty appeal to a foregone conclusion. She let out a piercing wail. ",[143,367,368],{},"The gun fired and the woman went to the ground in a seizure. A fake bullet stuck to her and sent an electrical burst through her. She’d live but it’d hurt for a while. I nodded to Arina who had a look in her eyes that indicated that was her first time doing that. I tapped her on the shoulder and led us up the stairs. I heard shouts, followed by alarms. The bad outcome. I loaded a stun bolt.  ",[143,370,371],{},"Up the stairs. One door guard, armored. He raised a gun. I raised my wrist and ducked. I fired just a second before him. The bolt struck him in the chest and the rifle’s shot went wide. He started convulsing on the ground, but would probably be fine. Probably. I checked behind me. The others had gone to ground. I smirked. We might be able to take this. I tapped my communicator. “D, how are you holding up out there? Praise.” ",[143,373,374],{},"No answer.",[143,376,377],{},"With worry, “D?” ",[143,379,380],{},"Static.",[143,382,383],{},"I looked to the others, who were looking down the stairwell. Arina called out “I count at least 3 more. They sound heavy.” I started eyeing the hallway we were in. I tried the door to Kanra’Las’ room. Locked, figures. I tried the others. No luck. I eyed the available furniture for cover. A few tables. Antique wood, but nothing that’d take a bullet. ",[143,385,386],{},"“T, got a smoke grenade?” ",[143,388,389],{},"They looked at me like I said something dumb. Then reached into their bag and grabbed a canister. Activated it, and threw it into the center of the room. A plume of red-grey smoke began to fill the hallway. Perfect. These two weren’t soldiers but I figured we had a fighting chance. I stepped back and loaded another bolt. Lethal this time. Pistol in my other hand. Let’s go. ",[143,391,392],{},"I heard a click behind me and the opening of the door behind me. I spun around. The deafening bang of a gunshot. I felt a deep heat in my abdomen. Blood soaked the clothes around my gut. An elek standing with a pistol in his shaky hands. Blonde hair, balding. Kanra’Las. The pain caught up to me. I crumpled to the ground. ",[143,394,395],{},"Temperance screamed and rushed towards me. I couldn’t think or see straight. It was like I was viewing the events through a few layers of removal. There was an Alice on the ground, bleeding out, but I was watching her from way high up. From the sky. Maybe from the void. I tried to remember the advice I had been given for this back in the service. My mind was too cloudy. From my aerial view, I saw guards swarming our position. Then I saw nothing.",[143,397,251],{},[143,399,400],{},"Ice-cold water splashed my face. For a moment it was like I was drowning. I thrashed weakly, like a caught fish. “He’s alive.” some distant voice said Then I felt someone grab my jaw and pull my mouth open. More water went down my gullet.  Some instinct took over in me and I drank it greedily. There was so much pain in my abdomen. I had never understood why people wanted water when they were dying, but it made more sense now. ",[143,402,403],{},"My vision returned to me. The two armed men who had been dousing me with a bucket of water left the cell. The cell. I looked around, my vision blurry. Pain too serious to think. The others were there. Or at least so I thought. Temperance ran up to me. Arina stood over. I saw Dorian in the corner of the large dark holding cell, arms folded. “Where… were you?” I spat out blood and groaned in pain. ",[143,405,406],{},"“I was hiding. Key, *was.* Until someone started blowing up my radio and gave me away.”",[143,408,409],{},"Some twinge of regret, muted by the agony. “S-so-sor-” I was shaking. ",[143,411,412],{},"Temperance shot their head back “This isn’t the time. She’s hurt.” They looked at me. “Healing potions don’t work on you, right? They tried to apply Formula Y and it just wouldn’t take.”",[143,414,415],{},"I nodded. I thought about dying. About my soul. I wondered how soon I’d get to see the beautiful land they said the gods took us to. I looked at the priest, “You’ll burn me…”",[143,417,418],{},"Temperance shook their head. “No, I won’t. I don’t burn the living. You’re not dead yet girl, come on. Stay with me.”",[143,420,421],{},"“Can’t you just magic it or something? You’re a priest right?” Dorian was sitting and sulking now. ",[143,423,424],{},"Arina agreed, “Yeah you could! You showed us that cool cloak technique out there!”",[143,426,427],{},"Temperance frowned. “Healing magic is difficult even for a full-fledged mage. The Lady of Magick doesn’t like us messing with the forms of others.” They paused, “I can try. Arina, keep her awake and alive. Dorian, just brood, I guess.”",[143,429,430],{},"The young elek ran up. “What do I do? What do I say?” She looked terrified. I imagined what I looked like from her point of view, pallid and dying.",[143,432,433],{},"“Just ask her questions.” Temperance was chanting something to themself and wringing their hands together.",[143,435,436],{},"“Okay… Hey Vulture. It’s Arina! You’re going to be okay. Just focus on my voice. Look in my eyes. My mom says she likes my eyes… Sorry, I’m nervous.” ",[143,438,439],{},"“It’s okay... They’re… a good shade of gold.” I offered. I was having trouble staying conscious. Maybe I could just sleep. ",[143,441,442],{},"Temperance smacked my face firmly a couple of times. “Hey, no sleeping. Arina, keep her awake at all costs.”",[143,444,445],{},"Arina jumped and ran up and repeated the face-smacking motion, though hesitantly. She looked like she was about to cry. “Hey, please stay awake. Uhm- tell me your name.”",[143,447,448],{},"“Alice…”",[143,450,451],{},"“Okay, great, what’s your last name?”",[143,453,454],{},"“Alice… Mercier-Durante.”",[143,456,457],{},"There was a pause. I knew I had said something I wasn’t meant to. It didn’t matter. I gnashed my teeth as Temperance put their hands in my wound. After a second they pulled back and tossed a piece of metal to the side. “The bullet is out.” They poured some of the water bucket on it. Then put their hands back on my wound. A strange warmth filled my side. ",[143,459,460],{},"“Okay… Alice Mercier-Durante. Where are you from?”",[143,462,463],{},"“My family is from Saliana… I grew up in New Bekton… s-since I was f-f-four.” I was shivering. ",[143,465,466],{},"“That’s a long way to go. Why’d your family move out here?”",[143,468,469],{},"“Doctors. For me. Organic.”",[143,471,472],{},"“That makes sense. Your parents must love you a lot.”",[143,474,475],{},"“They do. I was… I was their only…” I screamed, something sharp in my side, almost like getting shot again. ",[143,477,478],{},"Temperance made eye contact with me. Yasres had such intense yellow and red eyes. “We’re almost there Alice. Just hold on.”",[143,480,481],{},"Arina kept going, “You… were in the military right? Violetcoats. So was my dad! What was your battalion?”",[143,483,484],{},"“11th.”",[143,486,487],{},"“The Hand of Providence right? I never served, too young, but I heard a lot about you all!”",[143,489,490],{},"“Y-eah.” the pain was disappearing. Not like shock. Like the wound itself was leaving me. ",[143,492,493],{},"“Almost there.” Temperance was massaging the wound now. ",[143,495,496],{},"Arina looked up and tried to think of something to say. “Okay, Alice Mercier-Durante, tell me about some music you like.”",[143,498,499],{},"“Guitars… Folk instruments. Big fan of Natasha Irinde before…” Her turn towards Imperial sympathy was well known.",[143,501,502],{},"“Yeah, I was too.” Arina consoled. ",[143,504,505],{},"The pain was still present, but lessened and dull. Like being poked with the blunt edge of a pen. I looked down, and it had been replaced with a bulging mound of flesh. Temperance looked up at me. “It should be safe. It’ll probably leave a scar. I am not a professional healer.”",[143,507,508],{},"I smiled weakly, “Thanks.”",[143,510,511],{},"They stood up and went to take a seat on another bench, panting to catch their breath. My bench, I realized, was covered in blood. ",[143,513,514],{},"Arina did the same. Then she started sobbing, which triggered a look of disgust from Dorian. ",[143,516,517],{},"We stayed there in that scene for a while. I rested my head against the wall.  Dorian glared at Arina’s sobbing, and eventually, Temperance went over to console them. I realized their nose was bleeding. “You good, T?”",[143,519,520],{},"They nodded, putting an arm around our youngest. “Don’t worry about me, V. Get some rest. You lost a lot of blood.”",[143,522,523],{},"Arina stopped crying, going to that sniffling phase that often followed. Dorian eventually said something to her. “Is this your first job?”",[143,525,526],{},"The elek raised her head. “No, I’ve done a couple… No one’s ever gotten hurt before. We just took some stuff. Maybe we fired guns over people. Ykno.”",[143,528,529],{},"He scoffed, “They put me with amateurs.”",[143,531,532],{},"I turned my head, “Hey, leave her alone. She’s been doing fine.”",[143,534,535],{},"He looked back at me, “It wasn’t just her I meant.”",[143,537,538],{},"I forced myself to sit up and face him. “Why did you even take this job? It’s not like you need the money.”",[143,540,541],{},"“What do you mean?”",[143,543,544],{},"“Come on, your whole high maintenance, low awareness, fancy vibe. That’s someone who never has to worry where their next meal is coming from.”",[143,546,547],{},"“Not what this is about, but okay. Sure. I come from money. We even have a big stake in STARCAST. That’s why I’m here. What about you Ms. Mercier-Durante? I had you pegged for some poor first-generation immigrant, but I know your family. Made a huge fortune on the terraforming projects out east. You’re telling me that’s not money?”",[143,549,550],{},"I regretted my mindless confession. “I don’t take a dime from them.”",[143,552,553],{},"“And I don’t take a dime from mine! But the fact that you could, any time things got too bad. That’s what matters. You talk about being real, about wanting the real, but you’re just as fake as me. As the rest of us.”",[143,555,556],{},"I lowered my gaze, at a loss for words. I leaned back against the wall of our cell. ",[143,558,559],{},"After a few minutes, “I’m a Varan.” Arina volunteered, wiping her eyes.",[143,561,562],{},"“Good for you, sweetie.” Dorian’s tone was hollow. ",[143,564,565],{},"“Am I the only one here who isn’t secretly rich?” Temperance half shouted, half laughed. ",[143,567,568],{},"I looked at Arina, “Varan like…”",[143,570,571],{},"“Like Varanskeep yeah. That was my dad.” A doomed city, blamed on the failings of its rulers. A story known to all in recent memory. ",[143,573,574],{},"“I’ve met survivors but… why didn’t your family leave the country? Can’t imagine you have many friends here.”",[143,576,577],{},"“I don’t tell people my last name. I go by Arina Greencroft in my classes.” ",[143,579,580],{},"Classes. “How old are you?”",[143,582,583],{},"“21. I’m a senior at NBU… Or I was. I don’t think they’ll let me graduate if we get booked for this.”",[143,585,586],{},"My attention turned to the area around the cell door. A long mercrete hallway in either direction. No sign of any guards. They probably would’ve just let me die. There was a vent but nothing we could reach. “Did they say what they were going to do with us?”",[143,588,589],{},"Temperance had recovered, “Something about reaching out to STARCAST security to come pick us up. No one else with jurisdiction, I reckon.”",[143,591,592],{},"“Okay, so that can’t happen. How do we get out of here?”",[143,594,595],{},"“If I had my glove it’d be easy.” Dorian then pointed a finger at the priest. “I mean can’t you just magic the bars open or something? I’ve seen spell types bend metal before.”",[143,597,598],{},"Temperance shook their head, “Healing Vulture took a lot of energy out of me. I don’t think I’m casting again for a while.” ",[143,600,601],{},"Dorian shot daggers at me with his eyes, “So we’re stuck here because you had to save her.”",[143,603,604],{},"“What if it was you?” Arina snapped.",[143,606,607],{},"Dorian sneered, “It wouldn’t have been.”",[143,609,610],{},"I pulled myself to a stand and wobbled a bit. My muscles were weak and I was lightheaded. “It doesn’t matter. D’s right, I botched the job. So it’s on me to get us out of here. I don’t know how, but there’s got to be a way. Maybe we call the guards, and say I’m dying.. They don’t know I’m healed. Or-”  I became acutely aware that none of them were paying attention to me. Something was behind me.",[143,612,613],{},"I turned around and faced a purple drone with white spots floating at eye level.  Dotty. It adjusted its resograph lens to look at me. “Huh.”",[143,615,616],{},"We all looked at Arina, who held up her small hands. “Not me, they took my slate.”",[143,618,619],{},"I turned around again. The drone had protruded an exterior metal arm and was messing with the lock. “I think I know who it is.” I made a silent, solemn vow to fuck that woman senseless when I got back to the city. ",[143,621,622],{},"The lock relented and the door opened slightly. I thanked the drone and Arina and Temperance did too. Dotty, and presumably Birdie, gave an affirmative bounce. I peeked my head out into the hallway. One led to another cell. These cells were decently sized. Why did this place have the capacity to hold like 20 people? I shook the thought from my mind. The other way must lead out. I beckoned for the others to follow.",[143,624,625],{},"We stayed low and quiet. There was a resograph above us but it seemed powered off. Another gift from Birdie? The hallway turned. This building wasn’t big, we had to be nearing an office. I popped my head around the corner. Yeah, an office. Two guards in there. They were armed and armored, and we weren’t either. Though we had numbers. I looked at Dotty, not a combat model. I tried to think. What would we do in the service?",[143,627,628],{},"Shock and awe. ",[143,630,631],{},"I explained my plan through a series of complex gestures and whispers. They communicated back something along the lines of ‘you’re crazy.’ I retorted with a motion that meant ‘trust me.’ Then I reached into my leg and checked the hidden compartment. The knife was still there. Merciful gods.",[143,633,634],{},"I started to move forward. Once I was sure they didn’t notice us I stood up. Then I steadily worked up to a sprint, fighting past my body’s protests.",[143,636,637],{},"I rushed in and picked the one at the desk, a Primas-ika, judging by the slots for horns on the armor and their large size. I started stabbing in every weakness in their armor I could find. Several strikes to the neck. Their arm flailed for their pistol, which I wrenched out of their hand.",[143,639,640],{},"I didn’t think. I just stood back, disengaged the safety, and fired twice in the chest. Blood spattered on the chair, the wall, and the floor, and merged with some of my own on my clothes. Temperance, Arina, and Dorian were beating the shit out of the other one. They turned her in her swivel chair toward me. I gave her one shot to the head.",[143,642,643],{},"With both guards in the station dead, we collected ourselves. I tried to clear my mind of what just happened, and my eyes scanned the office. 6 guards in the facility, 6 desks. I looked at the primas-ika, with a special badge on their chest. Security chief. I figured the dead lady was the second in command. Good… good. I saw a row of lockers and footlockers. Several bags of items were placed on the ground. Our gear. ",[143,645,646],{},"We rushed over and reclaimed our things. Dotty was inert, whatever remote control was exerted over it having been released. How Birdie pulled this off at such a range was beyond me. Arina grabbed her slate and regained control of it. Temperance began the rites of the dead for the slain security officers. The stench of burning flesh filled the room and set off the smoke alarms. I opened a locker left open by someone careless. The contents within gave me an idea. “Hey, do any of you know how to pick locks?”",[143,648,649],{},"Dorian nodded and Arina raised a hand. Temperance stood up from the burned bodies, “What are you thinking V?”",[143,651,652],{},"I stroked my chin. “No way they don’t know we’re coming. We’ve been caught once, and *that.*” I motioned to the piles of ash from the dead. “We tried doing this the subtle way.”",[143,654,655],{},"Temperance looked at the lockers, opened by the other two. Arina fished out a heavy-duty vest, and Dorian was weighing a riot shield in his free hand.

He looked back down to the town around him. The alley he stood in was lined by composite structures, none of which rose above three stories. He stood on concrete pavement painted by dust and ash. There were countless settlements like this across the wastelands, but the relative centrality and size of this one had earned it the name Crossroads.",[143,840,841],{},"He hacked out the exhale and struggled to control himself. The thin air and his weakened lungs only hastened the urgency. He held the metal mask in his other hand to his face, and took a few cleansing inhales.

The cigarette's mild stimulant washed over him, a warm buzzing feeling.",[143,843,844],{},"He checked his watch. Their contact was late.

He sighed, stamped his cigarette out, and went to head inside.",[143,846,847],{},"The bar's entrance was sealed by an exterior airlock that protruded from its prefabricated construction. In this way, it was like every other building in Crossroads.

The hatch closed behind them, and he worked off his mask and took some deeper, unrestricted breaths. The interior was a small metal room with another doorway on the other side. It was lined with lockers and a few benches, where many of the patrons deposited rebreathers and protective gear. Two green glowstrips lit the room faintly from above.",[143,852,853],{},"Someone hit the button to cycle the airlock, and the background electrical hum climbed pitch to a whine. The smell of sterilizing agents assaulted the nose and left a lingering chemical taste on the back of the tongue.

Within a minute, the process was complete, and the interior door popped open into a bustling bar.",[143,855,856],{},"The persistent mechanical noise of the airlock was replaced by music and raised conversation. A woman with horns like a ram was singing and playing a guitar, accompanied by backing music from a soundboard. It was upbeat, folksy, and reminded him of the sort of music his kids would like. Many of the patrons ignored the music, but a decent crowd had gathered around her. Her melody carried to the rest over an internal sound system. The bar goers were a mix of locals and travelers of all different shapes and sizes.",[143,858,859],{},"No one paid Torinn any mind as he made his way through the central room.

You all are incorrigible!\" She tuned the instrument. \"I've got one more for you all. It's a favorite for true Astaelians! About a cowardly nobleman who abandoned his city. A man by the name of Lord Varan.\"",[143,864,865],{},"Torinn's heart sank deep in the recesses of his chest. He knew what song she meant. The crowd was ecstatic. She grinned and pumped her arms to hype them up, \"Oh you all know it? Great! Sing along with me! It's called The Lord of Nothing. \" Half the bar joined her.

The door swung open revealing the diminutive frame and irisless golden eyes of his employer, an elek named Gallin'Vir.

He didn't waste time on formalities. \"You're a quarter-hour late.\" The tempo of his speech was rapid, but Torinn had learned to keep up.",[143,910,911],{},"Torinn stepped into the private room as quickly as he could and half slammed the door. \"I ran a little long. Was checking the exits on the place and got caught up-\" He stopped himself. \"It doesn't matter. Place is as secure as we can ask for.

Are you high?\"",[143,916,917],{},"Torinn raised an eyebrow, \"When's the last time you saw me get high? Just polyspice.\" He looked around the room; like the rest of the building, it was constructed mostly of metal, though they hadn't bothered to wallpaper it. Most of the space was taken up by a large round table. A single suspended light bulb without a shade cast sickly white light over the walls, adding to the discomfort. Apparently they were displacing a weekly poker game.",[143,919,920],{},"\"Still, you shouldn't be smoking with your-\" Gallin'Vir stopped halfway through.. \"Never mind. Are we ready?\"",[143,922,923],{},"\"Up to you.\" Habit dictated Torinn check his weapon. He unholstered it and did a quick once over. It was a revolver with two firing chambers, one stacked on top of the other, a Jerris Model X. Firing both barrels kicked like a mule and required wrist augmentation for safety, but it was a cherished gift from his wife. He confirmed it was loaded and put it back.",[143,925,926],{},"The two of them made conversation while they waited. Plans for their return back east. Torinn's experience in this region. Gallin'Vir's work. 10 turned to 11, and 11 turned to midnight with still no sign of the people they were waiting to meet. At some point, Gallin'Vir started pacing. It made the bodyguard anxious, but he had learned to let it go. Brilliance often came with eccentricities.",[143,928,929],{},"At long last, a fist banged four times on the interior of the room's airlock, a pause, then three more. The signal. Gallin'Vir stood on his tiptoes, a thing eleks did when getting a handle on the situation. Torinn headed to the entrance. He began to open it, but was pushed back when it slammed inward. Three armed people barged in.",[143,931,932],{},"At their head was a shorter human woman with red-grey hair, a furious glare twisting her face. A two shot pistol shook in her hands.

A person who had been augmented to resemble a wasteland jackal. Fur, fangs and all. They brandished a standard military rifle.",[143,940,941],{},"Torinn knew there was at least one more. He glanced through the open airlock. Where was he? He glanced over to Gallin'Vir who had sat down and was keeping on a polite grin.

All that remained was a bulging bit of irritated flesh. \"Looks to be healing well. Don't pick at it, and it will be gone within the hour.\"",[143,1086,1087],{},"Torinn nodded and thanked his healer. Yender's Formula was a marvel, but uncomfortable. One's flesh and muscle repairing itself at that speed blended the sensation of burning and electrical tingling.

The container absorbed the impact. No fuel, as expected. No reason to think this would be volatile. \" He went back to looking down and took out a small black rectangle of metal and glass.

He knew how lucky he was, compared to many others, especially among the pre-Empire nobility. Gallin'Vir was doing important work, even if few other people realized it.

Good time, all things considered. The platform crowded with tired people as they shambled out of the cozy train into the bitter air of the night.

A bulky, 8-foot tall reptilian known as a Primas-ika, and their child had been stopped by metallic yelling from station officers. These officers, military police, wore sealed cobalt blue armor. One of the soldiers demanded to see IDs. Both parent and child pleaded for mercy as guns were waved in their faces. One of the cops pulled on the parent's long braids. The parent cried out and went to pull open their bag, perhaps a little too quickly. They were struck in the face with the butt of a rifle.

A custodial closet, too. At one end of the hall was the entrance they had come in from, at the other was a fork.

Around the corner appeared a tall metal exoskeleton with a smooth, round head and an impression of a smile on an electronic face display.

She stood up first, nodded to Temperance, and rushed out. She ducked and took a few shots. All guesswork: she couldn’t see any better in the gas than they could. Screams from the larger area around them — the glimpse she got from Dotty’s resograph said this chamber was huge.",[143,3140,3141],{},"She eyed a decorative stone wall that went on around the circular room as far as she could see.

A titanic round glass window was built into the outer wall, bringing in the natural sunset onto what seemed to be a place full of plant life, surrounded by stone grey flooring and walls. From here, three main exits. Access to the grand lift, some offices with several company names Arina knew and several she didn’t, and a security checkpoint to an area marked only with the image of a bubbling flask, underwritten in future-modern font: “Yender Medical.” Temperance pointed them toward the last one.",[143,3154,1858],{},[143,3156,3157],{},"In front of them, the Yender Medical guards were rallying.

No time to block the bludgeon the other was swinging at her head. She held her hands to protect her face. Instead a cracking of glass and the stench of flesh being destroyed. It was joined by one of the most hideous screams she’d ever heard in her life. She opened her eyes and saw the bludgeon guard on the ground, clutching his face, half burned off by some hissing chemical agent. “Holy shit.” It was so… real. “Holy shit.” What a gruesome way to die. “Holy shit.”",[143,3245,3246],{},"“Hey, don’t snap on me now, A.” Temperance grabbed her by the arm and pulled her along. “Oh fine, you wipe out a whole fucking squad of these fucks and it’s fine and good.

There was a desk, a bed, a kitchen, a bathroom, and windows that revealed the purples and oranges of the last glow of day. In the center of it all, in a couch setup in a shallow pit in the floor, was an elek. The person, presumably Theo’Vir, was in very fine lounge clothes.",[143,3261,3262],{},"The occupant spoke first. Either he was completely calm, or he had a really good face for playing cards. “Now listen, I don’t know what you’re here for, but I’m certain I can find something-” His accent was slight, but unmistakably Inerlesian.",[143,3264,3265],{},"“The journal.” Arina tried to make her voice lower and bigger.

Please, do be careful.” Arina wrenched it out of his hand and looked away, her face red.",[143,3279,3280],{},"Temperance had stepped forward, “One more thing.” They held out an ornate vial of dark green liquid. “Gallin’Vir’s regards.” In their other hand, a pistol that Arina hadn’t seen earlier.",[143,3282,2004],{},[143,3284,3285],{},"“T?” Arina was more surprised than concerned. Theo’Vir was awful, surely, but no one had told her this was a hit job.",[143,3287,3288],{},"The Yasre gave her a look as if to say “not now.” What they further tried to convey, unsuccessfully, was “Don’t you see how clearly this bastard deserves it?”",[143,3290,3291],{},"“So… it’s like that.” Inerlesians had a sense of honor about these sorts of things. Theo’Vir had two choices, he was dead either way.",[143,3293,3294],{},"The Director of Parathan Research walked towards his bed, slipped off his shoes, and drank the vial. “They’re not going to let her control the family fault. Inerlesian civilization is ruled by real men. Not pretenders, not frauds.” He lay down and closed his eyes. “Wretched disgrace,” were his last words. He choked on his liquifying insides and died.",[143,3296,2019],{},[143,3298,3299],{},"A sea of shouts and orders echoed towards them. Unlikely they were getting out the way they came, and here wouldn’t be safe much longer. Arina looked to her comrade, “T?”",[143,3301,3302],{},"“A minute, please. Ritual must be observed…” They paused their sentence to finish the prayer and add an amen. When they concluded, they produced a glowing orange capsule. The commotion was getting closer. Another prayer, and the capsule was broken open on Theo’Vir’s body. The body burst into flames that wondrously didn’t spread to the bed. The smell of a burnt corpse was strong even through their masks. In another life, well before Arina had known them, Temperance had been a priest of Death. Burners, they were often called. They still held their old practices in reverence.",[143,3304,3305],{},"Ritual observed and the spirit of the dead released, Temperance made quick strides to the windowed wall on bouncing avian legs. They started placing sticky explosives on the wall near the window. “You got something, T?” Arina asked, trying to purge the last few minutes from her mind. She didn’t even know there were still people who felt like *that.* She signed up to grab a book. She’d killed before, but no one had said this was a hit job.",[143,3307,3308],{},"Temperance took cover behind the couches, she did too. The explosives went off, and the howling open air tore through the space, papers from the desk swirled in the wind and blew outside. Another explosion shook the floor, Something had been destabilized. The Psried stood up and produced a spray canister from their bag.",[143,3310,3311],{},"They screamed over the wind that ripped papers and loose objects out of the tower. “So, current and only plan. You know how they used to fire people out of artillery back in your all’s war?”",[143,3313,3314],{},"Arina nodded. “My dad was in one of those units!”",[143,3316,3317],{},"“Well, this was meant to replace that. Didn’t get much field testing, though. But it *should* work.” They glanced at the kilometers-long drop down, and the environmental shield they would have to clear. “Okay, it might work. Probably. Maybe.”",[143,3319,3320],{},"Arina looked at the unfathomable distance below. How far up were they? “That’s fucking crazy.”",[143,3322,3323],{},"Another explosion shook the floor, this one more intense than any before. They had to brace themselves. Voices outside the door. Temperance looked toward the entrance, to the improvised exit, and back to her. “Got any better moves?”",[143,3325,3326],{},"Arina didn’t. She shook her head. “Fine. Sounds rad anyway.” She tried to convince herself that things that scared her were cool. She held out her hand to spray, but first they handed her a pill. “You won’t be able to breathe. This will help.”",[143,3328,3329],{},"She took the pill with apprehension, but she trusted her partner, her comrade. What other assurances did they have, if not each other? They embraced once more, and then Temperance began to apply the spray. It covered her person and began hardening like a stone. She couldn’t see it, but it expanded around her into a rough egg-shaped pod. The Yasre was right, she couldn’t breathe, but she didn’t need to. It was freaky.

The smoke cloud that filled my lungs was thick and harsh, accented with a citrus twinge. I held my breath and stared upward. From my rooftop, I had a perfect view of the glittering amethyst hexagons that made up the dome-shaped environmental shield. It always gave you something pretty to look at when you tilted your head up. Above it, a rolling tide of grey clouds with orange blots where the persevering dawn struggled to break through. I frowned slightly, it was another dreary day.",[143,3383,3384],{},"I exhaled a little too late and coughed for ten seconds at least. My vision went white and the sounds of morning dissolved into a dizzy, oxygen-deprived hum. I glanced around in a half-high, half-conscious haze, worried I had made a scene in front of a neighbor. Of course, no one was up there that early. My mornings on top of Pier 17’s stacks were usually solitary, and I liked it that way. ",[143,3386,3387],{},"I took another drag of the joint, it was a decent blend. Most heavier drugs didn’t work on me, because of my condition. This strain was homegrown by one of my neighbors, Uri. She was former clergy, and the naturalistic botany she practiced in service of Drais, The Gardener produced a smokable plant that my system could process, unlike the synthetics carried in most stores. Buying from her guaranteed an extra hour of conversation, but sometimes I learned something about church life. I took one more drag, put the joint out, coughed again, and blinked slowly. My vision was a little blurrier and my mind drifted a little. I closed my eyes.",[143,3389,3390],{},"I reached into my pocket and grabbed a small stone. I closed my palm around it, and began to murmur prayers. I prayed for the usual things. I prayed for my parents back east, for money, for good health, and for good fortune on the next excursion- that sort of thing. Then I sat in silence, listening to the beating of water against the concrete dock and the distant caws of a port raven. ",[143,3392,3393],{},"In the stillness, I began looking at the scene through the lens of an imagined resograph. Not a detailed image, but rather the very threads of reality that wrapped around it all. I saw the rectangular outlines of every tower of makeshift apartments and the expanse of the city beyond them. I saw my place, its roof, and the little nook I had worked so hard to make for myself. At the center was a girl with one arm, fairly tall even when kneeling, with a bowed head. She was Alice Talin. She was me. Moments of peace had been rare recently, but from this point of view, it didn’t seem so bad. ",[143,3395,3396],{},"A couple of shouts from the street below pulled me back into reality. I opened my eyes and peeked over the roof’s edge. The neighborhood kids were out early, playing some variant of a tag game. I chuckled.

A former storage container converted into a tight 1 bedroom, the same as the rest of Pier 17. I kicked down the folded stairs and made a careful descent. The hatch’s seal hissed behind me, a little strained. I’d need to replace the tubing soon. I did the cost calculation in my head and felt a knot form in my stomach. Money was never easy, but medical expenses had left things tighter than usual. ",[143,3407,3408],{},"I set the prayer bundle down in its spot and flipped on the radio, tuned to Dr. Swell’s talk show. Swell, an energetic DJ on a pirate frequency, had a bent for conspiracy theories. He was rambling on about a discrepancy in caravan records. He claimed this proved that the Empire of Astael was making traders disappear. I didn’t know anything about it, but it wouldn’t be surprising if true. I continued, half listening as I got dressed for the day. I had work later.",[143,3410,3411],{},"For someone with my condition, jobs are hard to come by. I couldn’t receive the chemical surgeries required to get specialized work, and even normal jobs were harder without the ability to metabolize potions.

If you needed something recovered from the wastelands, and you couldn’t turn to legitimate means, you hired a contractor from the underworld Community. If the Community wouldn’t touch the job, you called someone like Oren to find help. At the end of this chain of channels and backchannels were freelance scavengers like me. Scavvers, they’d call us. People brave– or desperate enough to go into the wastelands alone.  ",[143,3416,3417],{},"Yesterday, I got word via a messenger drone that Oren had work for me. I was expected to leave the city by the end of the day. I slipped on a simple shirt and pants, earthy colors. I had tucked the joint behind my ear while I worked on my jacket. Genuine leather was expensive, but my parents enjoyed modest wealth. They had it dyed a patriotic purple and had a gold gryphon sewn into the right shoulder, standard colors for Astael’s now-defunct Royal Army. They were so proud the day I enlisted. I didn’t like how the shoulders rested on my frame– much too masculine– but I had missed my parents since they moved. So I kept finding excuses to wear it; I just balanced the look with some makeup.",[143,3419,3420],{},"Swell had swapped to music. Something from a singing construct that went by Chytri Ganoda.

I had some gloves, climbing gear, a first aid kit, a space heater, and wind-shielded tenting in case I had to spend the night outside of the city’s border. Then of course the complex mix of metal bars, screws, and wiring that made up my crossbow. The weapon’s metal frame was collapsed and bundled into a metal rectangle with some bolts covered in electrical wiring. Finally, a rebreather; a small metal mask that wrapped around the face. A must-have for open-air exposure - even in the city only the foolhardy walked without one. My kit was simple as most scavvers went, but traveling light kept me nimble.",[143,3428,3429],{},"I packed up my things and slung the bag over my shoulder. I began to move toward the door but remembered to feed the fish first. When the food hit their water, the three of them shifted to a pleasant magenta, and they began to feast. I flipped the switch on the light and stumbled my way through my dark apartment. Furniture had to be inventively placed in a space as small as this, and walking it blind was an exercise in memory.",[143,3431,3432],{},"At the front hatch, I pressed the unseal button and waited for it to depressurize. I winced as my eyes adjusted to the brightness of the hazy morning. The cloud cover was heavy enough that it didn’t take long, but for a moment everything seemed so bright. I was now outside, on top of the scaffolding that stretched alongside rows and columns of improvised housing that stretched along the docks. I’d seen one of my neighbors take a nasty spill on a rusted-out step, so I always went down slowly. Inspectors didn’t often make their way out here.",[143,3434,3435],{},"I passed by Old Man Rorik, sitting with his airlock open and horn music coming from inside the unit. He gave me a nod and a smile but didn’t say much else. We were a neighborhood, but a lot of us kept to ourselves. Most of us preferred it that way. ",[143,3437,3438],{},"Overall, I enjoyed my time there, and it was as affordable as New Bekton went. Some rent control policies from the old administration were still in effect. My unit was one of the cheapest in the city, which worked for my strange and inconsistent income. My landlord was as nice as a housing baron could be, he even cut a hundred off my rent when he learned I was a former Royalist. There weren’t many friends of the Empire in this ring of the city. ",[143,3440,3441],{},"At the bottom of the scaffolding, the dock was a mix of mercrete and metal plating. New Bekton was a city on an island, which placed a limit on its growth. To avoid unnecessary infrastructure spending, the old Royal government sanctioned a group of piers to become emergency housing. That was 70 years ago, and any chance of a permanent solution under the new Imperial government was even less likely than under those before them. Pier 17 a fact of life. It wasn’t always the worst thing that it was. ",[143,3443,3444],{},"I crossed the dock to a group of skimmers. Vehicles that resembled a larger brass tube and a smaller steel tube fused together. Some of my neighbors were rich enough to own one of them, sectioned off in a private parking lot. Otherwise, the floating cars were the property of the Wakenfern Transit Authority. I picked the one closest to me and got inside. The interior was fairly simple, with a bit of graffiti on the dash. Certainly, it was clean and comfortable enough, albeit barebones. The radio worked, and that was enough for me.",[143,3446,3447],{},"I flipped to Dr. Swell’s show, now interviewing an ash farmer. I caught the conversation in the middle so I didn’t entirely get what was happening, but it seemed that they were discussing the ethics of a new alchemical pesticide used on ash yams. Specifically, its effect on the wine supply. Yam wine was a wasteland staple, the segment would do quite well. ",[143,3449,3450],{},"I reached for the ignition, a hole a couple of inches wide next to the control stick. I stuck my left finger in and winced as the needle pierced my skin. I withdrew my finger and held it tight while the machine processed my reading. I had registered when I got my license, like most kids. It would reference my genetic material and charge it to my account. I couldn’t remember my balance but I was certain I had enough for the day.  ",[143,3452,3453],{},"The simple dashboard display scrolled a “Welcome” to an old name I mentally blurred out. “Enjoy your ride!” and the vehicle hummed to life. I buckled in and flipped the brake lock. With a slight lurch, the skimmer lifted off the ground, orienting with me in the brass passenger tube on top, and the propulsion tube on bottom. I did a quick check for other vehicles, drone traffic, and everything else they train you to be worried about in flight school. I pulled the stick and began the climb to travel altitude. ",[143,3455,251],{},[143,3457,3458],{},"From the aerial vantage point, it became apparent why New Bekton was called The City of Rings. The island city was comprised of three tiered circles, ascending towards the center. The messy outer ring, Lowtown, is where I had spent most of my adult life. The middle ring, Midtown, was corporations, entertainment, and academia. Government and religious institutions centered in the highest Uptown ring. At the center of it all was a massive spire that shot past the environmental shield, the cloudline, the sky, and into the void, thus named the Voidspire. Lights were everywhere, and the airspace was smothered with traffic. The city strained against its island constraints, but somehow there was always a little more room for another development. ",[143,3460,3461],{},"Different parts of the city had their own unique energies. Pier 17 was a fairly chill place where people lay low. The same could be said of the adjacent South Lowtown, which had other low-income housing. North Lowtown was different. It was no nicer than any other part of the outer ring. The affluent parts of the city were the middle and center. However, the people in North Lowtown were hungrier than their southern counterparts. They had more drive. A day in the North Lowtown shops was always a pleasure.",[143,3463,3464],{},"I left my rental at another rental station and started walking. I kept my head down to avoid the constant stream of poster ads, something you learned to do if you wanted to get through a walk on city streets without a panic attack. I stayed close to the sidewalk's edge, doing my best to stay out of the way. Several buildings on the street had been closed down in a police raid. I craned my neck and looked for uniforms. Imperial blues, not New Bekton Law Enforcement olive. They were grabbing people for questioning. Best to get moving quickly. I darted a sharp right down the recently renamed Courage Lane, part of the new admin’s initiative to promote patriotism. ",[143,3466,3467],{},"There were a few nice businesses here, I often went down Courage to shop on an off day. The Azure Cat bar played soft Nur Fasaani folk music out of its opened airlock to my left. A young woman with spliced-on gills and a clipboard started to talk to me about corp recruitment. I made that hand gesture that was polite enough to acknowledge the person but firmly communicated “Not today.” My eyes wandered over a couple of pop-up market stalls that called to passersby on the right. I eyed a particularly cute doll in one of their displays, but the pathetic jingle in my coin purse reminded me that I didn’t have enough money for a detour. I frowned, then shrugged. Those stalls hiked up their prices anyway. The shop I needed lay just beyond.",[143,3469,3470],{},"Korvun’s Finest Apothecary was an unassuming old house that had been converted into a storefront through some questionably legal remodeling. Zealously placed signs advertised it as “New Bekton’s premier apothecarium.” They often opened late so I was hoping I had not come too early. The flashing “Open” sign rewarded my faith. I pressed the bright red button on the airlock and waited for it to cycle. These commercial ones were required to be larger than personal units like the one on the front of my place, unsealing them often took longer. ",[143,3472,3473],{},"The airlock opened and I entered into a small waiting room with a bunch of lockers and seats.  Most commercial buildings were required to offer shelter in the event of environmental shield failure. The interior chamber of the airlock had the painted image of a small plant rising out of a pile of dirt, colorful little bulbs hinting at fruit to come. It was a cute logo, I figured the shopkeeper's child made it, apparently, they were going for an art degree at the city’s premier University. ",[143,3475,3476],{},"Inside, the storefront was arranged to promote serenity. There was no overhead lighting. Instead, what illumination there was came from the interior lining of glass cases filled with plants. The lights were a celadon green, and cast a vibrant glow across the room, a thematic attempt at representing moonlight. In the shadows, menacingly lit by the lowered lighting was a tall and lumbering figure. I heard the metal floor thud and clack with heavy clawed steps as they approached me. ",[143,3478,3479],{},"I smiled and looked up, they were a couple of feet taller than me. “Morning Haela!” I said warmly. Haela was good people. They were a Primas-ika, tall and bulky reptiles. Their scales were a light grey but shone green in the light. Their curved horns were slightly outlined and the gold caps on them reflected a little shine, and their long false hair was braided around their shoulders. Haela smiled, revealing a mouth full of glistening sharp teeth. “Alice, my girl! How’s your week been?”",[143,3481,3482],{},"“Ah you know how it is, a couple jobs here and there. How’s the shop?”",[143,3484,3485],{},"This exchange was fairly routine. We talked about our days, my days in Pier 17, my social life, their work, their child’s career, and more. Haela began to retrieve my usual medication. They pulled out a couple of jars of different colored herbs and began to powder them up with an old-fashioned mortar and pestle. I enjoyed Haela’s shop for the focus on artisanal craftship at fairly reasonable prices. What’s more, not many people were experts on my condition, especially ones that I could afford without insurance.",[143,3487,3488],{}," “So…” Haela signaled the change in subject to more direct business, “Have you been spending more time outside the shield?”",[143,3490,3491],{},"The dim light of the room hid me from paling. We were doing this again, “Yeah, professional requirement.”",[143,3493,3494],{},"Haela’s sharpened teeth made a hissing sound of admonishment, “You shouldn’t be out there.”",[143,3496,3497],{},"“I know, I-”",[143,3499,3500],{},"They continued without pause. “The wildlife and other hazards aside, the air alone will corrode your lungs.”",[143,3502,3503],{},"“I wear a rebreather, Haela.” I tried to give a thoughtful smile. Haela was a kind soul, just opinionated. ",[143,3505,3506],{},"The aged Primas-ika laughed, “Bah, rebreathers. Do you think a waster wears a mask every day and doesn’t look different when cut open? At least they have tinctures and cleansing pills. You’ve only got the-” They stopped to count. “Two, two lungs my girl!”",[143,3508,3509],{},"I stammered, “Haela, I- I- I get it. Thank you for looking out for me but it’s what I’m doing for now.” I wanted to defend myself, say I was good at it, say that it made me feel alive. I chose to leave it at the assurance. ",[143,3511,3512],{},"Haela sighed, “Of course. I’m going to add some Moran’s Root to your supplements. It promotes respiratory health. Take a double dose when you’re out in the wastes. You’re 27 right?”",[143,3514,3515],{},"“Yes,” I was surprised they remembered, I was only vaguely aware that they were in their 50s. ",[143,3517,3518],{},"“It’s been a while since medical school, but if I recall, humans stop replenishing cells at a positive rate around that age. Most folks would just take a regen potion but…” They paused thoughtfully as if deciding something internally. They moved on from the thought, grabbed a handful of a root, and shaved off a few flecks into the gathered ingredients before them.",[143,3520,3521],{},"“I get you.” I nodded.  “Maybe I’ll win the lottery and kick it in Nur Fasaan.” We both did that little small talk laugh where nothing said was very funny but we were trying to keep it light. I appreciated Haela, they had been my go-to since I could make my own medical decisions. ",[143,3523,3524],{},"People with Nuralis Syndrome don’t tend to live long. It was rare, one in ten thousand humans was born without the ability to process advanced alchemy and augmentations. The things that kept most city-dwellers healthy without natural sunlight or good food sources. Doctors didn’t give me long. I wasn’t supposed to live long past 20. The gods had been kind to me, and I tried to repay that gift with my service when I could. ",[143,3526,3527],{},"My parents had been protective of me growing up, I wasn’t allowed to do much because they were worried I’d get hurt in some way that I couldn’t fix without a potion. Though they were proud of me for signing onto the Astaelian Royal Army, they had frequently urged me to take a support role. They went overseas during the war and never found out about my arm. I almost bled out because the medic didn’t know how to apply normal bandaging without a healing salve to seal the wound. ",[143,3529,3530],{},"Haela would sometimes check the scar and apply ointments and creams to try to return the skin to normal. They were the closest thing to a doctor I could see; most wouldn’t know what to do with me. Without the ability to integrate into chemical society most people with Nuralis Syndrome were left on the edge of civilization. “Organics” they called us because we were more or less the same as the day we were born. ",[143,3532,3533],{},"Haela finished mixing the bowl and started pouring it into a small machine that placed the blend into small pills. When done, it produced a bottle of a month’s worth of supplements and vitamins. They looked up at me, “Do you have enough hormones?”",[143,3535,3536],{},"I thought about it, and shrugged, “No harm in stocking up.” Gender transition for most people was as simple as a specially prepared drink or a salve. Some chemically assisted surgery here and there. I wasn’t so lucky, I had to rely on direct hormone replacement and old-fashioned surgical techniques. It was my life, though. I liked living, and it wasn’t like I was going to give up my identity. Haela was great for that too, with old-school know-how and the biolab they had in the back.",[143,3538,3539],{},"By most observations, I was healthier than most organics and I credited that to the apothecary’s amazing work. They were not cheap, which I was reminded of as I handed a small pile of crystalline coins to Haela. They did the math, made changes, and we said our goodbyes. On the way out I stopped by the little shrine to Iudan, The Healer. I whispered a small prayer of thanks for the bounty. Haela went back to work and I slipped out the door. ",[143,3541,3542],{},"I walked out of Haela’s shop’s airlock and popped one of the pills. I washed it down with my canteen. The hormones I’d need to take at home with one of my syringes. I stood off to the side of the stoop and lit my joint again. Natural hemp was in no way addictive, but I relied on it to drown out a background radiation of anxiety that came with the fast-paced New Bekton life. I took my first drag and exhaled into the air as pedestrians avoided me. For all the faults of the new Imperial government, they had eased restrictions on public smoking in the city-states, which was fine by me. ",[143,3544,3545],{},"Then I heard it. “Adrian!” I stopped dead. “Adrian!” the voice repeated in my direction. I looked around, hoping they meant someone else. In a panic my neck whipped around, looking for the source. I reached for a pistol that wasn’t on my hip. My breathing was fast. I cursed my illness, that I couldn’t transition like others, with their fancy chems and surgeries. I cursed myself for forgetting to shave that morning and wearing such a masculine jacket. I cursed the gods that would put me in this wretched form and insist I live with it. One last time I heard it, like the invocation of some kind of old and vile magick, “Adrian!” ",[143,3547,3548],{},"I located the voice, an elek standing about 5 feet tall. He had prematurely grey hair, those trademark irisless brass eyes most of the species had, and long, rounded ears studded with earrings that protruded half a foot from either side of his head. He was doing the thing that eleks do where they stand on the tips of their toes and ponder the situation. Then the recognition clicked. I knew this man. He cocked his head and slightly frowned, I could see him reacting to the look on my face, and considering if he had made an error. He carefully and apologetically, “So sorry ma’am, I think there was a misunderstanding.”",[143,3550,3551],{},"Panic and rage washed over into relief and joy, “Tar’Il?” I said though the voice that came from me is not the one he probably remembered. He perked up, “A-” he stopped himself, and considered the situation. I was just glad this was a friendly face, the worst-case scenarios that had been flooding my mind drifted away. “Alice, my name is Alice now. It’s been years Tar’il!” I was smiling, in part because it helps cis people feel comfortable after an incident, but also because I was just so happy to see him. ",[143,3553,3554],{},"“No shit!” Tar’il laughed. “How’ve you been? Is this where you’re holing up these days?” ",[143,3556,3557],{},"“Yeah, I live over in the Pier 17 development. Cheap waterfront property. Landlord’s nephew was another violetcoat.”",[143,3559,3560],{},"“Another Royalist! Good on him! You know what battalion?” ",[143,3562,3563],{},"I frowned and looked away, “The 21st.” ",[143,3565,3566],{},"“Oh…” Tar’il trailed off for a second too. Everyone knew what became of the 21st at the end of the war. After that mournful instant Tar’Il tried to recover. “Well hey, I was just about to head to a Hungry Reihn’s a couple blocks down. You want a bite? I’m buying.”",[143,3568,3569],{},"I rolled my eyes, “Do you live here?”",[143,3571,3572],{},"“No no, just visiting.”",[143,3574,3575],{},"“Of course you are, that’s tourist food. Come on, there’s a cute little cafe that just opened up on Victory Boulevard.”",[143,3577,3578],{},"We spent the next couple of hours catching up. We talked about our time in the war, my arm, our old CO. We had been in the same unit for a time. After the Royalists lost most of us scattered to the wind. Most of us took our skills wherever we could get paid. Tar’Il was in town for work, and we had been luckily in the same place at the same time. ",[143,3580,3581],{},"He said he worked in security and I said I worked in reclamation and we kept it at that. It was best to not ask questions about these sorts of things. We discussed the completion of the Voidspire, and how New Bekton had gone from a port town to a tech hub in just a decade. The sorts of conversations you have with an old friend you know you won’t see again for a long time. ",[143,3583,3584],{},"When we left the cafe, Tar’Il pulled me aside. We stood by the side door of the cafe in an alley. Tar’Il waited for a drone to pass by overhead, then looked at me. “So, you keep up with the Front at all?”",[143,3586,3587],{}," That cold headrush of disappointment hit me as I realized what was happening.",[143,3589,3590],{},"He continued, “We could use someone like you, Alice. Not even out there in the wastes, we need fighters right here in New Bekton!” He gestured to the Imperial drone floating away, and whispered, “You think these fuckers are gonna go away on their own?”",[143,3592,3593],{},"“I don’t do that anymore Tar, and I don’t appreciate the feeling that you just wanted to give the sales pitch.”",[143,3595,3596],{},"He held his mouth open as he thought of what to say, Eleks were usually fast with their words but he was clearly trying to be careful. “Alice no- I- I’m so glad to see you. I’m in town to do some work for them. I can’t tell you what.”",[143,3598,3599],{},"“I know.” I nodded reassuringly.",[143,3601,3602],{},"“Things are just bad out there, we need people like you.”",[143,3604,3605],{},"“Tar, dear, I’ve had this talk before with others from the unit. I respect what you’re doing but the answer’s no.” I gave that disarming smile again. ",[143,3607,3608],{},"“You’re a good one, Alice. Don’t let the wasteland life turn you sour.”",[143,3610,3611],{},"“Hasn’t yet,” and we laughed, clasped arms, and said our goodbyes. He gave me the address of his hotel in case I needed to get in touch, but we both knew that this was probably the last time we’d see each other for a while. ",[143,3613,3614],{},"I think a lot about that encounter. How just by happenstance we had been in the same district at the same time. How New Bekton pushes people together by making itself a necessity. It was the last time I got to talk to him. He was executed at an Imperial checkpoint a couple of months later. ",[143,3616,3617],{},"When my mind wanders I start wishing I had said more. That I told him how much his camaraderie meant to me, even if we didn’t keep in touch. Maybe I could have told him that the girl I was fucking makes fake licenses and IDs. Maybe he could have gotten some fake papers for the lash pistol the fascists found in his bag. Would he still be here? Thought exercises, little more. Tar’Il was gone, another proud son of Astael cut down by those who claimed to defend it. ",[143,3619,251],{},[143,3621,3622],{},"There were four main ways out of New Bekton. By boat, in the harbor, was common for commerce and shipping. The new Voidspire went into orbit and connected voidships to stations around the planet. Then there was South-Gate, which was mostly corporate convoys and well-licensed caravans. I was foot traffic, so West-Gate was my usual exit and entrance. ",[143,3624,3625],{},"Customs and Processing had been run by a branch of New Bekton Law Enforcement until recently, part of the Imperial takeover of the city’s operations. Normal business casual attire had been replaced by militarized cobalt blue armor and matching civilian jumpsuits. The environmental shield wrapped into the city’s border wall and its glowing amethyst energy hexagons added a persistent buzzing noise that added to the tension. I caught myself grinding my teeth more than once. Though, maybe that had more to do with the blood-stained wall behind the main office. ",[143,3627,3628],{},"I had my bag on my back and my gear ready. I made sure to stow my Royalist jacket in my pack and was down to my earth tones. My full-face rebreather was buried in my red-brown hair, ready to be brought down quickly.

Oren was expecting my return by 9 AM tomorrow. ",[143,3630,3631],{},"The main office had a booth in its front and guards nearby in any direction. The old human man in front of me had grafted a third leg onto his lower torso that he used to sit.

At one point this would have been twenty minutes, tops. ",[143,3633,3634],{},"An hour later, I was at the front of the line. The clerk was a woman with greying dark hair kept in a tight bun. This part of the exchange was familiar enough. I said my name was Alice Talin, she asked if it was spelled Allis like the god, I corrected and said with a C and an E. I handed over my city ID for reference. She asked my business and I gave it, scavenging was no crime as long as you stayed away from unsanctioned areas. She asked for my license and I paused. This was new. ",[143,3636,3637],{},"“Do you need to check for Class C scavenging?” I went a little outside the drudgery of old power cells and foodstuffs of Class C, but she didn’t know that. ",[143,3639,3640],{},"“New policy, all salvage licenses are processed upon city exit. We confirm transit tickets too. Tamps down on seditionist fraud.”",[143,3642,3643],{},"I clenched my jaw and went into the recesses of my wallet.

One of them drew a gun. I saw the look in the clerk’s eyes, she wanted it to happen. “Handle him,” she waved her hand and threw my IDs back at me. ",[143,3666,3667],{},"A squeaky male voice interjected, “STOP!”",[143,3669,3670],{},"The scene paused, everyone in line behind me, the guards, the clerk, and myself all waiting with bated breath.

I didn’t know his full name, I just called him Norm. ",[143,3672,3673],{},"“She-” He considered how to approach the situation, “They’re in the NBLE system.

For now, you may go.”",[143,3678,3679],{},"The guards let me go, I picked up my IDs in a hurry and scurried towards Norm, who shuttled me towards the gate in time for the 9 pm cycle.

I can’t help you like this again, get your papers in order… it’s only going to get worse.” I nodded and slipped him a 20-piece coin as a thanks.

For a second I could see New Bekton from the outside, how it looked to the world. A city guarded by a dome that looked almost fuschia in the starless night. A city on an island.

The world had ended more than once and still kept going. ",[143,3689,3690],{},"I tuned the radio to Dr. Swell’s frequency, now in the nighttime show. Swell had been dealing with fatigue so he’d delegated the nightly music show to his apprentice, a mysterious figure who went by The Fizz. The Fizz lacked the manic energy of his teacher, but always had an interesting fact to share about the artist playing. Tonight was Qiaran jazz, I almost swapped off to something more conventional, but the frenetic string bass had grown on me.

A wry smirk cracked my lips, I wonder now if somehow they knew. ",[143,3695,3696],{},"I got out and fell to the ground. I scooped up a handful of ashy dirt and pressed it to my mouth. I blew it away from me in clumps, it had rained a few days ago. I took a couple of contaminated breaths, in and out. Even at night, this place was beautiful. It was free. It didn’t matter who I was here, trans, Organic, ex-Royalist, whatever. I could just live.

Technically, the area I was entering was the property of the church, but I wasn’t in the market for any divine artifacts. My target was a derelict vessel from the Parathan Imperial era. Hundreds of years ago they had heralded the age of alchemy that we still lived in. An unsalvaged vehicle could be host to so many rare finds. I’d pay my rent for months. If it was military, it might have had some stuff for Tar’Il’s front, too.",[143,3701,3702],{},"I flipped a light on my face mask and peered into a crevasse formed by a seismic event. Sure enough, there it was. Made sense why it wasn’t found. I thanked the gods for my good fortune and wriggled my way in. I heard a clicking noise. Not my rebreather.

How long had it been since she’d had a drink? “Wa- wa- wat-” She stammered, too weak to speak.",[143,4095,4096],{},"He looked up at her, “What’s that, girlie?”",[143,4098,4099],{},"She pointed her left index finger at a flask on his hip. “Wat-er” with an additional emphasis on the -er.",[143,4101,4102],{},"He looked at his flask, “Aye, I can do that.” Holding the wound tight with the hand that had the rag, he undid the flask with his teeth and put some to her mouth. She opened wide like a baby bird, greedily lapping up the liquid.",[143,4104,4105],{},"“Okay, I’m going to apply the healing potion now. Have you had a Yender’s Formula treatment before?” He set the flask down and rummaged through his bag. ",[143,4107,4108],{},"“Yes…” This was true but for much more minor injuries. She’d never been hurt this badly.",[143,4110,4111],{},"“The wound is deep and on both sides. This is going to hurt, lass.”",[143,4113,4114],{},"She nodded. It didn’t matter to her. ",[143,4116,4117],{},"He took off the rag and uncorked a vial of red liquid. He poured some onto the exit wound and massaged it into the exposed flesh. This time she cried out. The pain snapped her awake and the reality of her situation set in. She started panicking. “Oh gods, oh gods, oh gods. Save me!” She begged the heavens and the man before her. ",[143,4119,4120],{},"“I’m doing my best. Almost there.” He pulled her forward and began to apply the healing Yender’s Formula to the entrance wound. Same pain, same cry out, same pleading to be spared. ",[143,4122,4123],{},"When it was done, he reapplied bandages and returned her robes to their normal order. He set her gently against the shrubbery and knelt there with her for some time. ",[143,4125,4126],{},"Certain the worst had passed, he grabbed another vial from his bag. This one was solid metal and had the icon of several drops of liquid on it. “Drink this, you lost a lot of your lifeblood.”",[143,4128,4129],{},"Mira took the vial and downed it, though she nearly wretched it up the second after. It had the aroma and flavor of spoiled licorice. Could licorice even spoil? She reached for the flask and downed more water. Her arms fell to her sides and she let out a long sigh. She cried, and the medic looked away to give her some dignity. ",[143,4131,4132],{},"When she was done, he took back the vial and flask. “That second potion should help your body regenerate blood more quickly. Take it easy, though. You took a licking.” ",[143,4134,4135],{},"Mira nodded and clarity of thought returned to her. “I understand. Thank you for your care, good doctor.”",[143,4137,4138],{},"“Vili’Mael or Doctor Vili works.”",[143,4140,4141],{},"She looked around. “Mira… May I ask where my things are?” ",[143,4143,4144],{},"He slid her backpack from behind him. “Right here. I grabbed it in the ruckus.”",[143,4146,4147],{},"Mira wrinkled her brow slightly, “Did you… open my bag?”",[143,4149,4150],{},"The doctor put up a hand, “No no, not my business. I’m just here to make sure you stay alive.”",[143,4152,4153],{},"She gave a slight smile, “The Council reward the servant’s heart, Writ of Duty 12:5”",[143,4155,4156],{},"He gave her a look, then brushed off whatever was on his mind. “The Divines says a lot of things– or they did, anyway. Do you think you can stand up?”",[143,4158,4159],{},"The pain shooting across her body had settled into a stiff, dull ache in her shoulder. “I… Didn’t think I was going to make it.”",[143,4161,4162],{},"“I won’t mince words, Mira. You almost didn’t.” He pointed to her bandaged right side. “The healing potions did their work, but that wound went untreated for too long. It’s going to be hard to move and it’s almost definitely going to scar.”",[143,4164,4165],{},"Mira nodded, then reached for her bag. It took her a few seconds before she found what she was looking for. She pulled out the cryogenic canister and rotated it in her hands. The green light on the side of the top confirmed the eyes were safe. She sighed in relief and said a brief prayer to The Ascended. ",[143,4167,4168],{},"Vili folded his arms and looked at the canister, “Everything okay?”",[143,4170,4171],{},"“Yes… yes, thank you. I was worried my pilgrimage had been for naught.” ",[143,4173,4174],{},"“Nah lass, you seem to be in order.”",[143,4176,4177],{},"She turned to him and continued rummaging through the pockets of the bag. She produced a handful of crystal coins. “I’m afraid I don’t have much with which to pay you.”",[143,4179,4180],{},"The doctor shook his head, “Not needed, miss. I didn’t do it for pay. My clinic does fine as is.” ",[143,4182,4183],{},"Mira put the coins in his palm, “Let no debt linger, Writ of Order 23:7.” Vili smiled back. Then she put something else in the other hand. A simple beige tract with bold red font ‘WHEN THE COUNCIL RETURNS, WILL YOU HEAR THEIR VOICE?’ She looked into his oversized eyes and grinned, “The gods smile upon you, Vili of the Great House Mael.” ",[143,4185,4186],{},"Vili didn’t react to this, beyond setting the coins and the tract down in his bag. He stopped and regarded her. “Are you a priest, ma’am?”",[143,4188,4189],{},"Her freckled cheeks blushed and she shook her head. “An acolyte. I serve the flock of Father Cyran.”",[143,4191,4192],{},"“Haven’t heard of him.”",[143,4194,4195],{},"“We keep to ourselves. The righteous are honed by the fires of adversity, Writ of Service 3:29. We have been faced with many trials and enemies.”",[143,4197,4198],{},"“Aye, well they’re well off with an acolyte like you.” Mira beamed at this. He continued, “Is that why you don’t have any augs? You an RP?”",[143,4200,4201],{},"She forgot how such a plain appearance made her stand out in the city. She twirled a strand of auburn hair on her finger. “No, the Righteous Perfect serve a noble cause, but we believe their complete rejection of the modern sciences to be misguided.” ",[143,4203,4204],{},"“And the folks who shot you? They belong to some religious sect too?”",[143,4206,4207],{},"Mira frowned, “I believe so, but they have lost the mandate of the Divines. They serve their worldly interests now.”",[143,4209,4210],{},"“Will they chase you? Don’t want all my work to be for nothing.” Vili started to let out a grim chuckle but caught himself.",[143,4212,4213],{},"Mira paid no mind, “With luck and grace, I have lost them. I will be careful on my return to my kindred.” She looked out at the mass of people coming to and from the gate. Then she looked toward the direction she was headed, “I need to get back to my flock.”",[143,4215,4216],{},"Vili nodded. “Aye, let me show you the way.

It was blue, foamy, and tasted like spiced berries. One might call it an unseasonable brew for the early Spring, but her journey in the cold sunless wastelands gave her an appreciation for the warmth on her palms. She huddled into a ball next to a low wall along the sidewalk, still regaining her strength. Her bag was right next to her and she eyed anyone who dared to get close. Most people steered clear of her warning glare. Oxen without masters. ",[143,4247,4248],{},"Before her, the rising skyline of New Bekton ascended layer by layer. Lowtown, the largest and poorest; Midtown, populated by corporate suits and wide-eyed academics; and Uptown, where the city’s most powerful elites resided. These sectors were built on top of each other in ring-shaped platforms that culminated in the grandness of the titanic central spire that shot past the cloudline and into space. Above the city and the base of the tower, a dome of purple hexagonal shields glittered. It stretched an entire island, protected from the harshness of the world the gods had abandoned. ",[143,4250,4251],{},"Of course, the gods had not truly abandoned Vian. Their grace showed in the diligence of the persistent faithful. Their ingenuity was present in the work of the engineers and architects of this strange new life. So many hearts had strayed from the righteous path the Council laid out for all. They called these thousand-long years The Silence, but to Mira, the gods’ voice could not be louder. ",[143,4253,4254],{},"She mouthed a verse to herself, “In all things, trust the Will of The Council.”",[143,4256,4257],{},"Father Cyran was expecting her. There was work to be done. She stood up, slung her backpack over her good shoulder, and threw her cup away. ",[143,4259,4260],{},"She briefly stopped to ask for directions from a construction worker with four arms. He was pleasant enough, though he mumbled when he talked. She wrote the important steps on her hand, thanked him, and handed him the same tract she gave to the doctor earlier. The worker obliged, though she caught him ditching it in a bin as she walked away. She wasn’t hurt, not every soul was within her power to save. ",[143,4262,251],{},[143,4264,4265],{},"It was hard to believe she was one of the godless, once. Her world had been transformed when the Reverend Father and his flock came into her life. Mira had never lacked faith, per se. She grew up going to church with her parents, was confirmed at the right age, and all the other traits one associated with a life of religion. ",[143,4267,4268],{},"It was just that, though, religion. Structure and practice hollow of belief. She was in university for mechanics when one of the robed Cyranites handed her a beige tract with red lettering, much like the ones she handed out now. She almost threw it out, but it had been a hard semester. Her mother was sick, and she had just been going through a particularly bad breakup. Something, which she now knew to be the Will of the Council, moved her to attend a meeting. ",[143,4270,4271],{},"The service she attended was unlike anything she had known from a childhood of sitting in pews in stuffy churches. There were colored lights, dancing, and joy. She had never seen such passion in the hearts of the faithful. She asked a boy with dusty hair and a cybernetic eye why everyone was so happy, and he simply told her “The dominion of the Divine is at hand.”",[143,4273,4274],{},"When Father Cyran stood to speak, she wasn’t sure what to think. His augmentation had already been extensive, which was not necessarily unusual. Yet his outlandish visage was hardly what you’d expect from a public speaker. When he spoke, his voice was strained and metallic. Then the words came from his mouth, and she understood. She had never seen such a command of scripture. Holy words resounded from his mouth and blended like music. Indeed many people hummed along. She realized that these words that made up the Writs were not just the writings of scribes, but the voice of the gods. If their words lived on in scripture, how could they be silent?",[143,4276,4277],{},"Mira never looked back. It was hard at first. The enclave demanded tithe upon entry, and she didn’t have much money. She sold her school books, her clothes, her jewelry, anything she could. She knew she would never need them again anyway. She had found her new calling. Cutting off the people in her life was harder, made easier by her mother’s passing. Friends and family she missed, but she had tried to get them to see the light of truth. They could not see, their hearts were blinded. They expressed concern for her, the fools. They couldn’t comprehend the bliss she lived in now. ",[143,4279,4280],{},"More importantly, the work of Father Cyran’s flock was too important. There were no empty promises of salvation. They would bring about the return of the Council. They had worked to do so for many years, and completion grew ever closer.

All the lights were working and the grime on the tiles was minimal. Concrete vaulted ceilings greeted the riders on two sets of tracks. One headed north to south, and the other headed east into the city’s heart. She eyed the crowd carefully. There were so many strange, wonderful people. Many modified by alchemical surgeries. She saw wings, shimmering hair, even some gills. Many were still like her, unaugmented and unassuming, enough for her to blend in. Even the blood stains on her robes weren’t too strange in this rough-and-tumble part of town. ",[143,4314,4315],{},"She got on the northbound platform and halted. She nestled into a corner next to an advertisement for lab-grown vitamins and tried to make herself small. Next to her was a man with wiry hair across his distended shirtless torso, a bestial snout, and yellow eyes. He was smoking some kind of cigarette. Not legal in the station, but rarely enforced in the new administration. ",[143,4317,4318],{},"Bestial eyes glanced at her, and a clawed hand passed over the cig. She accepted, though hesitantly, and while fumbling to keep hold of her bag. After all, the Writs said to graciously accept gifts from a noble heart. She took a couple of puffs, much to the disgust of people in front of them, and passed it back. The snout bent into a twisted grin, and she returned it. She offered him a tract but he politely declined, and they waited in silence.",[143,4320,4321],{},"The gentle buzz brushed against her mind and flushed her cheeks. Its comforting warmth was like the burning of incense, spicy and calming. She leaned against the ad display and for a second realized how tired she was. It had been a long time carrying these eyes, coming all the way down from Ziyo Point in the northeast. She vowed to sleep for a whole week when she returned to the compound. ",[143,4323,4324],{},"The train came squealing into the station and blew a gust of air into her face. She winced and looked around. The crowd pushed up on the platform where they thought the doors would stop. She took a breath, found strength, and pushed her way forward. ",[143,4326,4327],{},"The car was cramped, but it always was. New Bekton’s transportation had been overwhelmed since before Mira was born. She grabbed a hand grip from one of two poles that ran along the rows of seats and clung to her bag tightly.

Moreso now.",[143,4329,4330],{},"The doors closed, followed by a momentary pause. Then the train lurched forward, bumping her into a girl with a mohawk of tentacles on the seat below her. She glared at Mira, and the latter tried to get some space between them. ",[143,4332,4333],{},"Mira felt as if she was being watched. The hairs on the back of her neck bristled. She was not gifted with premonitions like some of her kindred, but in that moment, she felt a malevolent gaze upon her. She had been seen by something, or something else was wrong. She murmured prayers of protection. Nothing happened",[143,4335,251],{},[143,4337,4338],{},"A dozen blocks away from the enclave, wary paranoia gave way to grim clarity. Her premonition had been correct, almost certainly. Two figures had been following her from a distance since she got off the metro. Their cloaks concealed any more identifiers from her over-the-shoulder glances, but she knew in her heart and soul they were the same people who chased her to New Bekton’s gates.",[143,4340,4341],{},"She muttered the Writs while she pondered her options. She couldn’t lead them to the enclave, too risky. She could face them directly, but they had tried to take her life once before and she saw no reason they wouldn’t try again. While she would gladly become a martyr for her faith, she still had the eyes. They had to stay safe. She clutched her amulet and prayed for guidance. The clattering of rats across metal scrap drew her attention to an alleyway. It was filled with junk and debris, likely from the renovation of the adjoining tailor shop. It was perfect. ",[143,4343,4344],{},"She ducked behind a couple laborers carrying a couch, and slid into the alleyway, hopefully unseen. Immediately she began searching for a place to stash the treasure. A pile of opened crates, a broken drone, construction materials, and… Gods are kind! An old cooler, with perfect insulation. She opened her bag and started to hide the canister, then she heard footsteps at the entrance to the alley. ",[143,4346,4347],{},"She turned to see who it was, though on some level she already knew. Two hooded figures, one tall and one short skulked towards her. “What you got there?” the shorter one said, in a cool, smooth voice.

References to some heathen god that Mira couldn’t identify.

She yelled, “Stay back!”",[143,4364,4365],{},"The shorter one laughed, “I don’t think you’re in the position to be giving orders.” He flashed steel under his robe, attached to his hip. The same pistol that had wounded her before, surely. “Now last time, you got away, but we’re a lot closer now. Don’t think I’d fuck up twice.” ",[143,4367,4368],{},"She was breathing heavily as he drew the pistol, a revolver. Her mind ran through scriptures for wisdom in a time like this, all she could recall was the command to be defiant to your enemies. “I said… stay back.”",[143,4370,4371],{},"Both the dark-robed figures laughed this time, “The bravery! They don’t make disciples like you anymore. Tell me, lady, who do you serve?”",[143,4373,4374],{},"She thought for a second to declare herself a proud Cyranite, then reconsidered.

Can you stand?” ",[143,4471,4472],{},"“I can, Brother Jays. Just give me a second.” She grunted and groaned and forced herself to her feet with a wobble. Her head swam and she saw white. She was badly off, she needed help soon. If it wasn’t already too late.",[143,4474,4475],{},"“Excellent,  Father Cyran is already waiting for you.”",[143,4477,4478],{},"“Of… course.” Together they walked deeper into the compound, going slowly to accommodate her limping. First past the barracks, the kitchen, and the chapel. Then to the largest building, what was once a large warehouse, now the Sanctum. ",[143,4480,4481],{},"Outside this most holy of places, a podium had been set up. Others had already gathered and made way for Mira as she went to the front. The doorway was concealed, but in the shadows, she saw a figure shifting. She leaned against the podium, smearing blood on it. All the work of Doc Vili was wasted. She wouldn’t last long and she knew it. In a way, she felt some serene peace with this. She had made it to the Sanctum. That was all she had to do. ",[143,4483,4484],{},"From the entrance, a shape ducked out. He was radiant, beautiful, and perfect. She fell to her knees and face in prostration and weakness. “F-father…”",[143,4486,4487],{},"The cracked resonant voice of the Reverend Father met her, “You have done well, my child. Your journey nears its end. Look upon me.”",[143,4489,4490],{},"She raised her head and beheld his form. He was pitch black and wore no clothes. Most of his limbs were like tendrils and bent and contorted in ways that would be impossible for any other mortal. The ribcage had been enlarged and tapered down into an impossibly thin waist that expanded into jagged hips. His head sat atop a long neck, and his mouth and nose had been replaced by a fleshy grate-like structure that wheezed when he breathed or spoke. ",[143,4492,4493],{},"In the olden times, the angels were a manifestation of the Divine Council across Vian. The messengers of the gods, sent to carry their word into the world. Of course, Cyran had not been born an angel. His transformation had been long and torturous and was yet incomplete. His right arm was still mortal, human. Many of his internal organs still needed replacing, and in the front of his head were two normal green eyes.",[143,4495,4496],{},"She opened her bag and retrieved the cryo canister, presenting it in trembling hands to Father Cyran. His long left arm clasped her wounded shoulder and she winced, both in surprise and pain. “The great work nears its end. Soon I will gaze upon you with the true sight, as I will gaze upon the world.”",[143,4498,4499],{},"Mira tried to thank him, but drops of scarlet fell from her mouth and the pounding in her head overtook her. She collapsed and looked up at her congregation through fading vision.",[143,4501,4502],{},"Father Cyran did not come to her aid. No one else did either. Instead, the remade angel stood at the podium and looked to the crowd. He stood tall, dwarfing everyone. His voice was like hot steel passing through resin. “Our sister has brought us one step closer to completing our glorious mission. My eyes now see the faces of faithful men, women, and others who have dedicated their lives in the service of the most noble pursuit, ending the gods’ Long Silence!”",[143,4504,4505],{},"The Cyranites cheered, and the Reverend Father continued. “Soon, I will see so much more. Each of us was made for a purpose. The whole of Vian was. We feel it in our hearts, in our souls. There is no greater calling than service in the name of the gods. You know this, it is what drew you to our humble community. Our great curse is to be deprived of this assurance. To toil endlessly in the sunless wastes of the world the gods deemed unworthy of their light.”",[143,4507,4508],{},"He held up the canister, “But their light is not gone completely. My ears now hear their wisdom, and soon my eyes will see the beauty of the Divine!” The crowd erupted in rapturous applause. Even Mira, broken and dying, beamed. ",[143,4510,4511],{},"It seemed that the angel Cyran remembered her, looking down with a solemn expression. “Let us not forget the efforts and sacrifice of our good Sister Mira. There is no greater end than in the service of the Divines!” Scattered mournful ‘amen’s rolled across the crowd. He looked up and raised his distended, impossibly long arm, “Mourn not, kindred. For she will live on in the halls of the Saints!”",[143,4513,4514],{},"The crowd oohed and ahed in wonder. A rare blessing given to so few who passed. Even Mira, half-conscious and slipping away, could not believe she was so lucky. Was she so important? She was but a lowly handmaiden of the Council. ",[143,4516,4517],{},"Cyran made a gesture to the medic of their flock, Kindred Arin. They rushed over to Mira’s side. It was too late, no healing potion would save her now. Instead, they pushed a syringe of light blue fluid into her neck and pressed the plunger. A cool rush ran through her head and body as the stimulant took effect. Her wounds still hurt, and her blood still poured from her wounds. Yet her pain was lessened and her mind was clearer. ",[143,4519,4520],{},"She looked up to the Father, who stood over her. He spoke again, “Find your strength and arise, Sister Mira. Your journey is not over yet.” ",[143,4522,4523],{},"She complied, forcing what little reserves of strength she had to her arms and legs. She got to her feet once more, to the cheers of the other Cyranites. Through blackened eyes and shattered teeth, she smiled at them. Her family. ",[143,4525,4526],{},"Cyran looked to the flock one final time, ‘This will conclude our gathering. I will be occupied with the transformation in the Sanctum. Tonight’s study of the Writs will be led by Sister Yulna. Treat her with the respect you would treat me. Only Sister Mira will accompany me right now.”",[143,4528,4529],{},"The flock obeyed their shepherd and dispersed. Mira’s heart was beating fast. She was pale as a ghost, drained of blood. She and the Reverend Father made their way inside the Sanctum. ",[143,4531,4532],{},"Incense and candlelight guided their way through the empty halls. They passed custodians, mostly constructs, though a rare few mortals like them. The walls were lined with art and artifacts from before the Silence, reminders of the world the gods made and left behind. ",[143,4534,4535],{},"Mira heard the sound of a small drill as she approached the central chamber, the Holy of Holies. Now the walls were lined with body parts and organs, kept suspended in green liquid. So many former attempts, not all of them successful. Building perfection was not a trivial task. They could not compromise. ",[143,4537,4538],{},"At last, the lights of the central chamber bathed her broken form. Rows of lanterns and candles, mixed with overhead lights and a surgeon’s lamp. In the center, under the lamp, was a man in scrubs and an apron. She thought of Vili and wondered what would become of him.",[143,4540,4541],{},"Father Cyran went forward to the operating table, carrying the canister. She kneeled there and watched as the surgeon began to work. First, the old eyes were removed, and placed on a tray. One eye, and then the other. The smell of cut bone and chemical solvents mixed with the candles and incense into a confused medley. A wet ‘schlick’ sound as the new eyes were set. Then there was quiet for some time. ",[143,4543,4544],{},"The three waited and waited for some time longer than that. Then Father Cyran’s new eyes opened, red and shiny as rubies. He looked first to the surgeon and thanked him. Then he stood up, head bumping against the lamp. He went over to Mira, whose stimulant was beginning to fade. Her breathing had slowed and grown ragged. It was almost her time. She wondered what it was like to die. Though she knew with pride that she would be embraced by the gods. ",[143,4546,4547],{},"Cyran scooped her up in his surprisingly strong, mismatched arms. He carried her to the next room over, and as exhaustion took hold of Mira’s body, she couldn’t help but wonder. “F-Father, what… do you… see?”",[143,4549,4550],{},"Cyran’s mouth folds distended into a facsimile of a smile, “My child,” he looked up, “I see everything.”",[143,4552,4553],{},"She slipped away one final time, her work completed.",[143,4555,251],{},[143,4557,4558,4069],{},[872,4559,4560],{},"The angels departed from her that evening.",[143,4562,4563,4069],{},[872,4564,4565],{},"She made their mission clear, to carry the holy words of the Ascended and the rest of the Council to the people of the world Vian.",[143,4567,4568,4069],{},[872,4569,4570],{},"Sometimes, one would minister to her the will of her Mistress, then just as a shadow, it would disappear again.",[143,4572,4573,4069],{},[872,4574,4575],{},"These things were, are, and shall be.",[143,4577,4578],{},[794,4579,4580],{},[872,4581,4582],{},"The Ascension of St. Dralia 10:21-25",[143,4584,251],{},[143,4586,4587],{},"Mira awoke, though still not in the bright halls of the heavens.

He did not come to the Saints often, but when he did he sought wisdom. Rarely, another Cyranite would approach them to refill their life support systems, or to join in their hymns. Most of her days were dark and quiet, kept away in the reserves of the Sanctum. She spent many of her days singing the hymns she knew and even writing new ones. She had all the time in the world.

You acted without your mind, and dragged the body- now surely dead- off to the side of the road. ",[143,4816,4817],{},"It was mandated by faith and law to burn the dead, even if you were the killer. Of course, no court or sheriff would ever hold you to account for what you did. You were no murderer, just a person protecting yourself. Nonetheless, the task of burning the body and releasing the soul of the dead fell to you. You went off to secure your horse and retrieve a cremation capsule from your supplies, but you never came back. ",[143,4819,4820],{},"Maybe it was the looming storm and the beginning of the rain. Maybe you figured another traveler on the main road would take care of it, maybe a traveling priest of death. Maybe you just said fuck it. After all, this man would have gladly mowed you down. Why did he deserve your courtesy? So you left him there to rot.",[143,4822,4823],{},"You left his bike too, though you considered taking it with you. You remembered a delivery girl they called Siren who had stolen a vehicle from a law officer she had successfully overpowered. She had been tracked down and hung using some internal locator on the vehicle. You didn’t know what organization the man you killed belonged to, but you didn’t want to take the chance that they would be similarly prepared. You took your horse and your things and you left.",[143,4825,251],{},[143,4827,4828],{},"You carried on the main road for a while, but a gnawing paranoia overtook you. Who was that man? How did he know your name? Were there others, and would they know where to find you? ",[143,4830,4831],{},"You took the first fork in the road that you saw heading in the same approximate direction. This branch was less well kept, less trodden. It was littered with debris, and you might have lost the path were it not guided by an occasional splash of red paint against the rocks lining the sides.",[143,4833,4834],{},"Come to think of it, you had never seen this road before. You pulled open a map of the south you kept on hand, and found the intersection where the fork would be.  There was nothing. You checked again, and checked the publication date on your map. It was a recent enough copy. No sign of this road. It wasn’t unheard of, for side roads made by locals to not make the official record, but you clung tighter to the reins anyway.",[143,4836,4837],{},"The rain began in earnest, unforgivingly acidic. You stopped, covered the supplies and package with a tarp. You worked on a thick plastic-polymer poncho. It did not cover you entirely, but enough to be safe from the caustic downpour that was to follow.",[143,4839,4840],{},"It did follow, and the skies opened up over the plains. The rain beat an improvised rhythm on the road, yourself, and the hardened mutated hide of your horse. It started in that almost musical percussive way, but soon the torrent drowned out all else. If it kept up, you would need to find shelter.",[143,4842,4843],{},"You carried on for an hour, the toxic sludge that formed on the ground squelched and splashed beneath the reinforced hooves of your steed. You thought about the rains where you grew up. You had grown up on a farm, growing yams for a nearby city. Your whole family was part of the trade, along with several others. You worked closely with your brother managing a harvester. You did this for a great deal of time, but wanderlust had always tugged at your heart. Your life was elsewhere. When your brother’s accident happened- or at least you told yourself it was an accident- you wasted no time putting in your notice and you rode as far away as you could in a single week. ",[143,4845,4846],{},"It had been years since that day. Some part of you missed the relative safety and comfort of that life. The larger part of you, even when traversing through the grime and mud of some forgotten road, would never look back for a second. ",[143,4848,4849],{},"Though, you did look back in a more literal sense. First you noticed the scarlet paint on the rocks was washing off. Was that paint? Over the rain a hum could be heard, louder and louder. A rumble like thunder but too quiet for that. You turned your head and your jaw went slack. In the distance, but clearly enough, you saw the shadowed outline of a figure on a bike riding toward you. ",[143,4851,4852],{},"There was no way it was him, you had certainly sunk enough lead in that man’s body that even redundant vital organ implants wouldn’t have saved him. You destroyed him. Yet that bike was coming right towards you, the rider with those damned luminescent purple goggles. There was no one else on this road, and he was gaining. ",[143,4854,4855],{},"You did not wait to confirm your suspicions, you kicked the side of your horse and broke into a sprint as fast and far down the road as you could. It was no use, the motorcycle was going to overtake you. Your eyes scanned the horizon for terrain to go into. A petrified forest gave the most obvious hope of escape. Your heart pounded with the beating hooves beneath you. You cleared into the forest and maneuvered at top speed around long dead trees.",[143,4857,4858],{},"You were looking back to confirm you were making distance. You didn’t see the stray root in front of you. The horse let out a hideous whine of pain and tumbled into the ground, launching you forward. You rolled head first into a log, and the world went black.",[143,4860,4861],{},"You did not die there, not yet. Though the blinding pain you woke up to made you wish you had. When you came to and the confusion settled, your hands went to your face, and you felt the blood soaking your coverings. You could barely breathe through your broken nose. You panted out of your mouth raggedly and your heart and head pounded in sadistic unison. A terrible noise was coming from not too far away from you. You sloshed out of the soggy ground and sat against the log to get a better view of the scene.",[143,4863,4864],{},"The bike was nowhere to be seen. You had lost him, or whoever that was, but your horse was crying out in pain. Two of its legs were apparently broken. You felt a twinge of sadness for it, then a rush of fear as you knew that your pursuer might hear. You crawled through the mud over to the beast. Only your nose had been broken but the pain in your body was too intense for you to stand on your own. ",[143,4866,4867],{},"You got next to the beast and stayed clear of the poison barbed tail that thrashed wildly around its hindquarters. A knife went uneasily into the creature’s hardened throat, and with some effort on your end you managed to sever its major veins and arteries. The equine blood you were sprayed with merged with your own and your clothes had become a macabre showcase of reds and browns. The horse looked at you with terror in its eyes, it did not understand what had happened to it, or why it had to die now. It kicked and spasmed, and its eyes rolled into its head. It died scared, and you looked away to spare yourself the guilt that bubbled within you. ",[143,4869,4870],{},"When it was quiet, and when the pain you felt became manageable, you made yourself stand. You assessed yourself for wounds. Nothing serious, though you’d need to apply some healing formula to a gash on your nose, and your hip where you snagged a branch. You collected the crate and whatever supplies you could carry. You made camp there that night, carefully. Then you wandered out.",[143,4872,4873],{},"It occurred to you that you weren’t sure which direction you were going. The gnarled brambles and broken trees didn’t give much in the way of landmarks. You thought you identified a unique formation of a fallen tree balanced on the limbs of two others, but there were at least two other instances of that. You kept limping until eventually in the distance you saw buildings. You thanked the gods and pressed forward. ",[143,4875,4876],{},"The structures were unusual, antiquated. Wood siding, hatch roofs, windows. No visible airlocks outside of any of them, though you’d heard that some recent designs had tried to obscure those. You approached, the weight of your gear on your back and the box in your hands compelling you to rest. ",[143,4878,4879],{},"You collapsed near a well, another antiquated design. No machinery you could see. Were they really just pumping water from the ground unfiltered? Maybe they had filters in the houses themselves. ",[143,4881,4882],{},"You craned your neck toward the town, two rows of houses down a main street. Not a single shop, bar, town hall, or anything else you’d expect to see. Isolated settlements weren’t unusual, but to have nothing besides housing was odd. A faint mist crept at the fringes and swallowed the distance. Leftover from the rains perhaps. ",[143,4884,4885],{}," You tried to figure out what kind of place this was, and then you heard the laughter of children approaching. They rounded the well and you saw them. 5 children dressed for St. Dralia’s Day, monsters and popular figures from all across the world. Their leader wore a red cape and a mask that bore the image of one of those titanic lizards from out west, a drak. You blinked and rubbed your eyes. You wondered if it was already St. Dralia’s Day. You wondered further why the kids weren’t wearing any apparent breathing protection in the open air. ",[143,4887,4888],{},"They stared a while longer, and you stared back. The one in the drak mask pointed and spoke, “Bloody rags!” and started to laugh. The other kids began to laugh and sing along, “Bloody rags! Bloody rags!” They circled the well a couple of times, dancing and chanting their song. You got to your feet and began to walk. The mist had intensified but you could see everything within settlement, more or less. ",[143,4890,4891],{},"They pursued you briefly but then broke off to a house. They knocked on the door. An adult in normal clothes opened the door and passed treats out to the assorted receptacles held by the kids. You looked back, and when they were done, the adult just stared at you. Face blank, eyes filled with something you couldn’t identify, but made you walk faster.",[143,4893,4894],{},"The process repeated, groups of kids rang doorbells across the street, treats were passed out, and the occupants of the houses just stared at you. You were not too far from civilization, or at least you didn’t think you were. These people acted like they hadn’t seen an outsider in months. Years maybe. You resolved within yourself to clear this town and get back to the main road. You wanted to ask for directions, but you felt you’d find no answers here. The mist was consuming you now. ",[143,4896,4897],{},"As you approached the edge of town the kids encircled you again. There were more of them now. Their song had developed, albeit tunelessly. “Bloody rags! Bloody rags! Walk a winding road, but there you’ll find your end.” You stood silently as they encircled you. From behind, the adults had gathered without protective gear, forming a stoic wall that blocked you from entering town again. ",[143,4899,4900],{},"The mist overtook visuals, and the singing grew louder. “Bloody rags! Bloody rags! Thought you killed him, but there you’ll find your end!” You clutched your things and tried to find an escape but it had grown so thick you couldn’t even see a few feet in front of you. Your heart pounded and there was this gnawing chill down your spine. You hadn’t been seen when you killed him, when you didn’t burn him. You were sure of it. Did someone tell them? ",[143,4902,4903],{},"The fog cleared, the singing faded into the distance, and you were alone. No sign of the costumed children, no sign of the mob of adults, and the town that had once been restored and full of life had turned dilapidated and ancient. Long abandoned, and its inhabitants long dead or their descendants moved to a safer location. You were alone on a barren stretch of the wasteland, not far from a road. ",[143,4905,4906],{},"You were paralyzed, the events of the last twenty minutes played through your head on repeat. There was no such thing as ghosts, you were sure of that. Though, you were increasingly less sure. You lit one of your cigarettes from the yasre caravan, and let the harmonious melody of buzz and high take you.",[143,4908,4909],{},"When it was burnt down, you carried on for a few hours more in the dark. The Sight you smoked let you move without a lantern, and the world had taken on a faintly light green hue. You spent the whole evening watching the terrain for approaching apparitions or the return of the rider. Finally you slept, and you dreamt of home.",[143,4911,4912],{},"You dreamt of the partner you had left behind when you rode away. You dreamt of your family, and you dreamt of your brother. You were there at your father’s funeral again, and he was out on the veranda. They let you use the manor house to do your mourning, the owner of the farm was not cruel, though he was rarely overly kind. ",[143,4914,4915],{},"You saw your brother crying out there. Some part of you knew it wasn’t just about your father. He carried some unfathomable weight that you could only scratch the surface of. Something you could never truly get your head around, though you tried to in the days that would follow the accident. You thought about going out there, talking to him. You didn’t, and only you really know why. So many of your thoughts are unknown to me. When it comes down to it, would it have saved him? Would it have saved you?",[143,4917,251],{},[143,4919,4920],{},"You carried on for a week without much trouble. You managed to use some discretionary funds to buy a horse from a ranch you passed. You’d still make good time for the commission bonus if you kept up at this speed. The weather had been pleasant enough, and you even got a bit of natural sunlight through breaks in the clouds. ",[143,4922,4923],{},"Some natural plantlife dotted the central south wastelands. You weren’t far from the place from the Ancestral Glades from which much of the forest life of the continent once stemmed. It had been a comfortable break from the tumultuous start of the journey. No one knew, no one had followed you, and you wondered if the second encounter with that rider was even real. People saw things in the wastelands, too much isolation from life was bad for the mind.",[143,4925,4926],{},"Your new horse was white with a red mane and horns that curled like a ram. It lapped up water from a spring that would have been toxic for you, but was safe for its adjusted internal biology. You enjoyed another cigarette and lowered some of your cloth to get some sun on your skin. It burned your pallid flesh but it felt like being reunited with something missing. ",[143,4928,4929],{},"When you heard the engine your heart stopped for a second. Then, not just one engine, but several. A multitude even, cresting the hill from whence you came. You saw trucks, buggies, and bikes pass by until the cloud of ashen dust they kicked up was too thick to see anything clearly. You kept your hand close to your pistol out of well-learned caution, and maybe some paranoia. The convoy continued on without a care for you, but you felt a piercing gaze buried in the crowd. ",[143,4931,4932],{},"When it was clear, you wiped your eyes and you checked your things. The box was still on your horse’s back. That wretched box. The one that had made your life such a nightmare for over a week. You had thought about opening it, but magical seals would reveal your treachery and you knew that. The Church would have its retribution and you would die. Still, some part of you so desperately wanted to know what all this was for. Why not carry it by caravan? Air travel? One courier was nothing. You weren’t even a real courier by professional standards, more of a delivery person. ",[143,4934,4935],{},"You shook your head of the thoughts and looked back to the road, now covered in tire tracks. There was something else in the road, too. Something large, in two pieces. You hesitantly walked over. Then you gasped and fell to your back. You scrambled away and peered over. It was a body, your body, but it couldn’t be. The clothes, the height, the build, it was you. Except the head, which had been severed and replaced with a ceramic helmet. On its face a neon painted smile, sloppily scrawled like a kid would draw. ",[143,4937,4938],{},"Away from it a few feet was the real head. You walked closely toward it, checking the road and surrounding terrain for traps and watchers. You picked it up with the caution of someone handling a bomb. The face you saw was not yours, but it was close. The hair color, the eye color, all correct. The nose was slightly off, but the message was clear to you nonetheless. You dropped the head and screamed into your hands, trying to muffle it. You collapsed onto the ground and sobbed. Why this had to happen to you, you didn’t know. You cursed the job, and considered just dropping the box. You knew this wasn’t an option, not if you wanted to survive. ",[143,4940,4941],{},"Your only options were to move forward and deliver the crate, or die to them or to this unseen tormentor. You steeled yourself, and you searched the body. You found two things on it, a note, and a small glowing orange capsule. The note was written in wild scrawl, by someone with not much control over their hand. “You should have burned me.” and a crude drawing of a heart alongside a barely legible skull. ",[143,4943,4944],{},"How could he have survived? You were so sure you had done the job. You cursed yourself for not burning him when you should have. It was a sin, the 12th sin in Church canon. You were not an avid practitioner of the faith but reverence for the dead went beyond religion. What if it had been you? You rationalized it, said it was a matter of time. You had been so sure a traveling burner would do the job for you. We like to explain our sins to ourselves in ways that make us out to be more noble than we ever really were. You were no different in this respect.",[143,4946,4947],{},"You took the capsule in hand and collected the two scattered pieces of the body, your body. You burned it, and it did not take long. The stench of flame searing flesh slithered its way into your rebreather’s vents and stayed there long after the job was done. In mere minutes, the body turned to ash and this poor fool, killed as a pawn in some other game, was put to rest. ",[143,4949,4950],{},"You got on your horse and rode as fast as you could away from there.",[143,4952,251],{},[143,4954,4955],{},"You rode for almost a day straight before you found some caves you could convince yourself they were safe enough to take rest in. Another storm was coming and you thanked the gods for the shelter. You were another day from the nearest town. ",[143,4957,4958],{},"You saw the lights in the cave and that gave you some pause. You carefully peered inside, and you were fairly sure it wasn’t the man you were looking for. Instead, you came inside and found me. I had been waiting for you, but I didn’t tell you this. You brought your horse and things in and I greeted you pleasantly. The fire was roaring and I was sitting cross legged in its warmth. ",[143,4960,4961],{},"You were taken aback. Perhaps you didn’t know what to make of me. After all, I don’t wear the protective gear you did. I do not need to do these things to survive out here. I marveled at you. You looked exactly how you did in your mind’s eye, though maybe a little more ragged, and a little shorter.",[143,4963,4964],{},"I offered you a seat, and when you secured your horse you joined me. You had grown so wary by the time we met. You kept your hand near your gun at all times. Maybe you were always like this. I knew so many things about you, but I knew so much less than I wanted to. Even now, you’re a mystery I’ll never get to solve. This is okay, I do not need answers. I appreciated your company all the same. ",[143,4966,4967],{},"You regarded me carefully. Perhaps you recognized me but you couldn’t figure out where from. It clicked when we introduced ourselves. You said your name, which had such a delightful ring to it. I said mine, and you knew me as “Ridlek of Morwood.” You did not believe this was a real name, as St. Ridlek is a figure of legend for you. For me, it is just life. The only life I know. ",[143,4969,4970],{},"We talked. You asked me what I was doing out there, and I told you the truth. I was on pilgrimage to the Glades, and then I would continue on to the Veil that bordered the south. I asked you why you were out there, and you told me a lie. Something about going to see your family out in Sidersberg. I let you keep your secrets, we both quietly knew the truth.",[143,4972,4973],{},"I offered you some wine, and you said no at first. I took a swig and let its bitter, metallic taste fill me. I offered again, and this gesture of deference was enough to convince you to say yes. You took out your last two cigarettes and offered me one. We had a delightful evening drunk and high at the fire. You never asked what was in the wine that tasted so strange, and I never told you. It might have mattered, had things gone differently. They did not go differently, so it did not matter. ",[143,4975,4976],{},"When we were thoroughly intoxicated, I asked more about you. We talked about a lot of things. Life on the ash farm, life as a delivery person, the differences between delivery men and couriers in Astaelian parlance. You asked about me and I told you about life in Morwood, what it’s been like seeing the sights. You assumed I was lying. Maybe I was. Time, space, reality… All things I experienced differently from you. We would never have had enough time for me to explain the truths I knew and still know. It did not matter, this was not my story. It was yours.",[143,4978,4979],{},"We talked about your family, about your mother, father, and brother. You told me a bit, though not everything. You were glad to have a chance to speak about it. When the evening had grown long you admitted that you felt as though you were being hunted. That you had been turned into prey for some kind of predator that had decided to toy with you before making the kill. You did not tell me about shooting him, or about failing to burn him. You just said that you were worried. Worried that if you didn’t figure out something you would be consumed.",[143,4981,4982],{},"I told you, plainly, that you had to finish the job.",[143,4984,4985],{},"When you woke up the fire had smoldered to embers, and I was gone. I left behind the flask of wine and another gift for you. So you knew I was real, and so you knew how to best handle your phantom. ",[143,4987,251],{},[143,4989,4990],{},"Another week passed and you traveled safely. More signs that you were being followed cropped up. Dead animals, notes, splatters of blood. You had grown desensitized to it. It invoked less a sense of terror, and more a grim inevitability. You would find him out there. My words carried with you, and you would finish the job.",[143,4992,4993],{},"You picked a place and began your work. At the farm, hordes of wild boar would occasionally try to make a run on your crops. Fighting them with conventional weapons was impractical. So you would set traps and feast on wild pork. The same principle as now. You would hunt the hunter, or you would die trying.",[143,4995,4996],{},"My gift you placed in pieces against the exterior wall of a rocky tunnel, carved into a cliff face to keep the road going. A handheld device connected to them all, though you set several cables of thin twine to set it off should that fail. You stood at the edge of the overpass, and made certain that the natural lay of the land made it impossible to circumvent without passing through this point. Your enemy did not know you were prepared. ",[143,4998,4999],{},"You waited, and kept waiting. So long passed that you began to wonder if he would even come at all. You knew he would, but he always seemed aware of your movements. Maybe he saw this trap coming?",[143,5001,5002],{},"When you were about to pack up and give up, you heard the familiar engine. The bike roared down the road right at you. You stood and held your hands up, a feint of surrender. By the time the man could see your smiling face, it was too late. You pressed the button and threw yourself to the ground as the blast shook everything. ",[143,5004,5005],{},"You blacked out briefly and your ears were ringing, but when you came to you saw the tunnel collapsed. You cheered. Though you realized now you had no means of burning the body. You had to burn the body, so you started trying to pull scorched stones off the pile. Maybe the body was destroyed in the blast? Would you be so lucky? ",[143,5007,5008],{},"You went back to your horse to grab a tool to dig through the rubble. You were met with another blast and a with a searing pain in your back and stomach. You gawked at the hole in your gut. You tried in vain, and through hideous pain, to put your intestines back in your body. You collapsed to the ground, the blow to your spine left you unable to walk. You spat up blood that filled your mask. You ripped it off and looked around in desperation for the source of your wound. At the edge of the tunnel there was a man, or a creature, half of one. Ichor pooled together into the body of a humanoid, you would not have identified it as the rider were it not for the hat and clothes had had been absorbed into its form.",[143,5010,5011],{},"It held a shotgun that smoked from the blast. It was not human, not any of the other species either. You’d never seen anything like it. Beige twisted flesh sculpted itself into new life from some kind of liquid slime state. It held the gun with distended, unnatural arms that flared off into tentacles in every direction. Some kind of mutant? A lab subject? You never got to find out. ",[143,5013,5014],{},"You crawled toward the crate. Your blood stained the ground beneath you. Your head was light and your heartbeat irregular. You would not survive. You had to know what was in the crate. You had to know what this all was for. You pulled it down and unsealed it. The reassembled man- or rather creature- stood over you. It waited for you to open the box, and it trained the gun on you for a final shot.",[143,5016,5017],{},"Inside the box was the same sterile white. Secured in its center was some kind of book, face bound in ancient leather and marked in a language you couldn’t begin to comprehend. Your head was light and your strength failed you. The rider kicked you over, away from the case. ",[143,5019,5020],{},"When you come face to face with a monster, it is natural to expect to see cruelty, malice, bloodlust. These things make sense to us. They are impulses that even someone who isn’t a monster could feel, given the appropriate context. In this way, we expect monsters to be like us. We make them more human than we have any right to, because we are more comfortable with the things we know. ",[143,5022,5023],{},"When you looked into the rider’s gnarled, twisted face. You saw nothing. No hint of desire or want, no hatred for you. It was as empty as the void, and in your final moments that is what scared you the most. When it raised its shotgun and fired a blast that pulverized your skull, it did so without care. It simply did what it was supposed to, like a biological machine. ",[143,5025,5026],{},"It did not leave you there to rot. It burned you.

I prayed for myself, too. I beseeched the gods to get me out into the open air again - real air, away from the city and all the bullshit.

This field of energy shielding the city from the rolling clouds of ash above, turned black by the night.

In the center of it all, the grand spire that shot all the way into orbit. The smell of chemical exhaust hit my nose. It wasn’t my favorite, but at least it felt more honest. ",[143,5336,5337],{},"I caught an aircab and considered where to go to find my contact.

It was almost 11 now, and I hoped the person I was looking for would still be there. Some girls with matching glowing hair offered me a bump of Frost. I declined respectfully, though they didn’t know what to make of me saying it would make me sick. They started talking to me about dosage and safety, which I sat through patiently until it was our turn at the bouncer. ",[143,5350,5351],{},"Haelga was at the door tonight. Good, Haelga knew me. They were big, even for a primas-ika. I always wondered if they had gotten muscular-skeletal work done, but it never really felt like my business to ask.

Under the environmental shield, it was more of a formality, available for emergencies. Some people made use of the complimentary lockers inside to stow some belongings and change into their clubwear. We could all feel the thrumming bass of the music within. Someone pressed the cycle button. It ran its process, and upon completion, the interior door popped open.",[143,5377,5378],{},"I stepped out and was hit with a wall of sounds that moved everything around me. A heavy, pulsing bassline that drowned out the melodies above them. I worked on my headset, meant to help talk over the noise. To my left, the bar, to my right, a sea of people on the dance floor. I stopped by Kal at the bar and played nice. Ordered the Korvuni Blue, which tasted like fermented citrus, and hit like a truck. Haelga made a good call.",[143,5380,5381],{},"I paid for the whole bottle, took it, and traversed the floor from the outskirts, along the tables on the far side.

Some part of me was glad. “You kept it.”",[143,5446,5447],{},"I nodded. ",[143,5449,5450],{},"She swirled the edge of her neon-colored drink with her finger. “Okay, fine. Let’s go back to my place. You can tell me the details.”",[143,5452,251],{},[143,5454,5455],{},"I woke up in Birdie’s bed with her tangled around me. My head was fucking killing me. The digital clock on her nightstand said 6:54 a.m., but the lack of windows made it hard to verify. I lifted my head as best I could without disturbing her. My eyes adjusted to the faint power lights of electronics scattered across her spacious bedroom. The brightest of them was the dim yellow glow of the powered-off liquid immersion tank in the corner. My eyes rested on my bag and prosthetics, placed on a chair in the corner. ",[143,5457,5458],{},"I looked down at her, nestled into my shoulder. Still fast asleep. She was clutching my good hand, or I would have run it through her hair. She really was beautiful. I stared at her body for a moment, physically gifted too. The night before was fun. Lovely, even. Some part of me still couldn’t shake the feeling that I was going to let this woman down.",[143,5460,5461],{},"The clock struck 7:00 and a shrill alarm sounded. She stirred, crawled over me, and turned it off before returning to my side. “Morning, Alice.” she eventually muttered into my skin. ",[143,5463,5464],{},"“Morning, Birdie.” Her hair trilled when I used her name. ",[143,5466,5467],{},"She was quiet for a bit. Her hair flattened, “Are you going to ghost me again?” ",[143,5469,5470],{},"There was this pit in my throat. The awareness that comes to one when they realize that they had almost made some terrible mistake, only to be pulled back from the brink by chance. Perhaps by fate. “No, I think we’re past that point.”",[143,5472,5473],{},"“So, we’ll do this again?” the trills were back.",[143,5475,5476],{},"I glanced at the cluttered room and tried to trace a walkable path with my eyes. “Maybe at my place next time, but yeah.” I disentangled myself and retrieved my clothes from the edge of her bed. She tried to help me get dressed, and I gently warned her off. I made my way over to my bag and my limbs. I had daily maintenance to do, but that could wait until I was back at my place. ",[143,5478,5479],{},"“So where did we leave off on the Kanra’Las villa?” I said while fitting on my arm. ",[143,5481,5482],{},"She was wearing a bra and her shorts from last night. She retrieved an infoslate from a library near the tank and was pressing the scroll button to look through it. She danced over to me triumphantly and delivered in a singsong tone, “This should be allll you need.”",[143,5484,5485],{},"We stepped out of the door from her bedroom/office, and into the living space. A long metal table was covered in papers and the empty bottle of Korvuni Blue we had brought back with us. The room was lined with other furniture. At the far end was a well-stocked kitchen and pantry. Birdie explained last night how this was once an interrogation chamber. She made sure it had fallen off official records.",[143,5487,5488],{},"I looked through the tablet. This definitely was everything I was looking for. “This is so thorough.”",[143,5490,5491],{},"“It’s my job, I know things.” she pointed to the shelves lined with round sports ball-sized fungus drones. The original, less intelligent counterparts of their sporeborn cousins. “They learn things for me.”",[143,5493,5494],{},"I was impressed. I glanced at the doorhatch and she saw me looking at it. “Heading out?” she seemed sad, but a different kind.",[143,5496,5497],{},"“I’ve got to get to my apartment and shave and shower. Do my daily things.

You wanna come with?

It had followed this pattern for all of its 10 years of operation, without variance. Today, it departed at 5:17pm. A slight difference noticed by almost no one but the most time conscious of passengers. Those few were shut up with complimentary drinks.

One of the rejections was a 10 year old girl who had just received a spinal implant so she could walk again. The drug didn’t work, she rejected it and went septic. She died a few weeks before her 11th birthday.”",[143,5866,5867],{},"“You-”",[143,5869,5870],{},"“What’s wrong, speechless now?” ",[143,5872,5873],{},"“It doesn’t matter.

Yeah, I’ve got a body count. Who doesn’t, if they’ve lived a little? I knew the whole fucking time, I probably even heard about the girl you mentioned. Didn’t remember because honestly?

They all  knew what a Courier was. “In truth, I do a bit of information work. Even some hits when I need to. Unfortunately, my client said I couldn’t kill you.

Instead, I’m going to turn you in.”",[143,5935,5936],{},"Elise was gripping the armrests of her chair, “You have to know that any evidence collected this high up isn’t admissible in court.

My friends can hear.” Dorian tugged at his jumpsuit and revealed a black metal square with a couple of buttons and receiver for audio input. Less bulky than any wire Elise had seen before. It fit under Dorian’s tight bodysuit perfectly. “New kind of comm unit. It’s interesting tech! I’ll probably ask to keep it.”",[143,5959,5960],{},"A banging came from the door. A loud metallic voice demanded to be let in, claiming to be Lieni Drug and Augmentation Enforcement. ",[143,5962,5963],{},"Dorian’s smiling teeth were perfectly white despite the smoking, “Oh those are my friends! Well, work acquaintances, really.”",[143,5965,5966],{},"“After all that you’re a fucking cop?” The look in her eyes was wild and desperate. “Orda, kill him!”",[143,5968,5969],{},"Dorian looked to the bodyguard. “Orda, my only target is Elise.

They fell over the coffee table and onto the floor. The two struggled. She clawed at his face, drawing blood from his cheeks. Dorian’s training kicked in and he punched her where the heart would be if she had one. It knocked the wind out of her and he sprung to his feet. The cops rushed in and tackled her.",[143,5992,5993],{},"“For what it’s worth, I do come from money. But I’ve made my own fortune ending careers.” Another smile, “Like yours.

He admired himself a little longer. Then he turned toward the room, his room now. It was spacious and quiet. Perfect really. He poured himself a club soda and relaxed on a couch, legs up.

He admired the heavenly light as it was consumed by the cloudline it hovered above. ",[143,6007,6008],{},"It was a while longer before the airship’s 3am landing. Outside he could hear the festivities of the imminent holiday. Maybe he’d go out, meet some interesting people. Live a little.

Swell was doing a fan favorite segment Seris Uncovered where he reviewed the audio drama Seris Rising and compared it to historical information about the real early families of the Parathan Empire.

Any scavver worth her merits had a competent internal sense of the stretch of wasteland they operated closest to. The terrain outside shifted from the outskirts of the city, with its ash farms and refineries, to that liminal space where you’d see the occasional building or compound, to the open wastelands. I gazed out my reinforced window at sulfur marshes, jagged rocky terrain, and petrified forests. Life. Real life.

Sure enough, signs warning of private property ahead began to line the roadway. I made a hard right and watched for drones and spotter towers.

I did my best to keep near the border signs but parked us behind a stone formation that hid the full frame of our vehicle. ",[143,6749,6750],{},"We disembarked, unloaded the cargo, and I set the car’s safety mechanism. I bent down to the ground and scooped up a handful of ashy dirt. The others looked at me like I was insane when I took off my rebreather and took three deep breaths of the air. It was a bad air quality day, and it smelled like it. It was heavenly. ",[143,6752,6753],{},"I touched the rock and held my pendant.

When I tell you to do something, you do it. There will be no discussion, no debate. Obey me. 2. If you see something coming at you that isn’t one of the four people here, you shoot. Corporate soldiers, Imperials, marauders, wildlife, the fucking Helping Hands Brigade, open fire. 3. If we come across a ruin, do not touch *anything*. No matter what you think it’s worth. If it looks like a good haul, tell me. I’ll look at it, and I’ll even let you keep it. That’s how nice I am.

The voices outside were still talking. Too far and too metallic to make out details. It sounded like bursts of radio static in conversation with each other. Three? Yeah, three voices. I stuck my head out very slightly. Nice armor, armed well, and a mounted turret on their truck. Corporate for sure, couldn’t make out which one. No way we were taking them. I tapped the worn wall with my metal fist. This wasn’t going to hold up against turret fire. ",[143,6775,6776],{},"So the next question, what do we do? We could have left out the back and hoped they didn’t see us. Too much open land, and not enough concealing terrain. Taking them out already wasn’t an option. That left wait, but that depended heavily on what they were doing out here. If they were just passing by, why stop here? If they were a patrol, they were probably going to check this structure. So, how thoroughly?",[143,6778,6779],{},"I looked at the rest of the tower structure above us. Early Parathan Imperial as best as I could figure. The solid granite building would give way to blends of basalt and decorative marble later in their reign. There were two more floors, partially exposed by a collapse in the structure. I wouldn’t trust the top floor but the middle floor didn’t look too bad. The stairs went in the collapse, so we’d have to get creative. I made a mental path of things we’d have to climb to get up there. Quietly, if the gods were kind…",[143,6781,6782],{},"One of the metal voices was getting closer. My choice was made for me. ",[143,6784,6785],{},"I motioned the others to follow and made my way from a pile of ancient, hardened sacks of grain. Next, I grabbed a rusted wall sconce and used it to swing up to the protruding lip of a column. Then I leveraged myself into an alcove in the wall, and from there I could reach the second floor. I grabbed it, solid enough on this side. Praise the gods. I wriggled my way up and started helping the others following the same path. Arina was almost too short to make the last jump, Temperance and I had to help her up. ",[143,6787,6788],{},"We got up just as the patrolman reached the threshold.

Sounded like something running around in here. Praise.” There was a quiet that followed, I heard each heavy step of his boots. He got closer to the edge of our floor. Arina was sticking too close, I pulled her back by her legs. ",[143,6793,6794],{},"“Don’t see anything. Same empty tower. Orders? Praise.” ",[143,6796,6797],{},"There was some second end of the conversation we couldn’t hear. ",[143,6799,6800],{},"“Yeah, probably vermin. I’m headed back. Praise be.” The boots began stepping away, then past the threshold. Temperance started to stand up, and I whacked them on the back. I made a down motion with my hands. We weren’t clear yet. I waited until the truck’s combustion engine came to life, and drove away. ",[143,6802,6803],{},"I peeked my head out of the window on our floor. “Clear.” Sighs of relief all around.

He landed like a cat. Fall augmentation? Arina and Temperance went down with a little more caution. I checked around for any unscavenged swag. No use. This place had been picked dry centuries ago.

IT WAS ENCHANTED!” He punched me, aiming for my nose and instead jamming my mask deep into my face. I stumbled, confirmed nothing was broken, then I pushed him back. We struggled, I hadn’t realized how much I wanted a chance to knock sense into this prissy idiot. I got him in a headlock for a second, he drove an elbow into my gut. Temperance pulled him back.

Instant, aggressive mania.",[143,7296,7297],{},"The door where the noise was coming from was off in a hallway. Too small to be a bedroom. Too big to be a closet. An office maybe? Didn’t matter.

They were frantically trying to grab something. ",[143,7299,7300],{},"She popped out, rifle up. For an elek, time didn’t move the same. Sometimes if they focused enough, it could slow down a bit. So when she raised her gun and saw the janitor from earlier charging her, she wasn’t terribly surprised. Must have gotten a healing treatment. She saw the ornate sword in his hand, glanced up at the display case on the wall above the desk, and she put two and two together.

Her focus faltered and time returned to normal.",[143,7305,7306],{},"She went all in center mass, headbutting his unarmored gut. He doubled over and she ripped the sword from his hands.

The Red did the thinking for her. She taught him who he was dealing with, and started stabbing. She brought the blade down again, and again, and again. Long after he stopped moving.",[143,7314,7315],{},"She stood up and held the dripping sword in her shaking hand. Dotty stared at her, unmoved. She felt her lips, she was bleeding. Not bad enough to care right now. She grabbed her rifle, put back on her helmet, and left the sword by the corpse.

She had this frenetic energy about her. I figured it was fine, whatever gets the job done. We made it to the stairs, I wobbled out of my chair and began our march up.

Three of them, behind deployable cover, in sealed armor. We settled in our position and crouched. Temperance threw a glass sphere over our heads. It landed in the middle of their defenses in a whoosh of flame. One of them caught fire and started howling. Shields down, we opened fire. Two of them went down easily. Bullets across their torsos. The third got a shot off and I heard Dorian exclaim. Arina retaliated with a shot to their neck. They went down suffocating. ",[143,7325,7326],{},"6 guards down. That should be them all.

Start searching the floor and walls.”",[143,7343,7344],{},"We started doing a thorough search of the place. Trying for buttons, levers, and switches. Anything that would reveal a pod an elek could hide in when he got scared. Finally, a decorative wall panel came loose. I ripped at it until it gave way. Then all four of us pulled the pod out.

We were going to get fucking paid. ",[165,7400,7402],{"id":7401},"_5-epilogue-scavver","5. Epilogue- Scavver",[143,7404,7405],{},"My radio clock woke me up to the familiar chaos of Dr. Swell’s morning show. I wasn’t sure when, and if, he ever slept, honestly. I moaned, rubbed my eyes, and sat up. The side where I’d been shot ached a bit, and was plenty red still. Probably would be for a long time.",[143,7407,7408],{},"I listened to the radio. Normally, it was music this early, but he had taken a break for a special news bulletin. Something about a group of raiders hitting an estate in corplands and absolutely massacring the inhabitants. Casualties included the entire security team and at least one civilian. He went on to talk about how the government was characterizing the assailants as ‘chem-addled.’ Swell further alleged that this was a false flag operation to further discredit drug use, which the Empire had been working towards recently. He kept going, and I swapped to a folk station.",[143,7410,7411],{},"I remembered what day it was and hopped to my feet. I washed my hair and brushed my teeth. I glanced at my neglected razor and thanked the gods I’d been able to afford some natural hair removal treatments. ",[143,7413,7414],{},"I got dressed and remembered to put my clubwear from last night in my hamper. Temperance, Arina, and I still partied every now and then. Dorian joined us for a night, but no sign of him since. That was okay, I didn’t really think we were friends. I was pleased with them all, though. I’d work with that crew again any day. Maybe no good as thieves, but a fine strike team. A valuable skill, in its own right.",[143,7416,7417],{},"Today, I had a different kind of job. I’d reached out to Oren, and told him I was getting back in the scavver trade. He told me about a professor at the University who was looking for someone not afraid to deal in Parathan relics. I said I was the girl for the job. ",[143,7419,7420],{},"So I got my first contract since my accident a year ago. I stared at my shiny new gear like the hard-won prizes they were. I got suited up. I even got this cool open-visor helmet that was just my shade of purple. It was magnificent, I loved it all so much. I loved what it meant for me even more. I was a scavver again. A real scavver. ",[143,7422,7423],{},"I stepped out into the rest of my apartment. Like the rest of The Stacks, it was a modified storage container that I’d been living out of since I was paying my own rent. I fed the fish, watered the plants, and ate a quick breakfast. I made my way towards the door and remembered something. I stopped at the entryway table and opened a small crate. Inside was another drone, this one orange with olive-green stripes. A gift from my girlfriend. ",[143,7425,7426],{},"I picked it up and set it gently in my bag. The front hatch to my place hissed as it unsealed. I took a deep breath, and I got back to work. ",[165,7428,7429],{"id":668},[160,7430,672],{"href":671},{"title":148,"searchDepth":674,"depth":674,"links":7432},[7433,7435,7436,7437],{"id":7244,"depth":677,"text":7434},"Previous: 3.
