It smelled not unlike burning moss.",[149,286,287],{},"He took a long drag, held his breath, and looked up. The sky was smothered in dark clouds, occasionally broken by pale green rays of moonlight. He looked back down to the town around him. The alley he stood in was lined by composite structures, none of which rose above three stories. He stood on concrete pavement painted by dust and ash. There were countless settlements like this across the wastelands, but the relative centrality and size of this one had earned it the name Crossroads.",[149,289,290],{},"He hacked out the exhale and struggled to control himself. The thin air and his weakened lungs only hastened the urgency. He held the metal mask in his other hand to his face, and took a few cleansing inhales. When his breathing had calmed, he brushed a bit of dust out of his grey hair, and let himself enjoy the quiet moment. The cigarette's mild stimulant washed over him, a warm buzzing feeling.",[149,292,293],{},"He checked his watch. Their contact was late. He frowned at the bad sign, but there wasn't much to be done about it now. His boss would know what to do from here. He sighed, stamped his cigarette out, and went to head inside.",[149,295,296],{},"The bar's entrance was sealed by an exterior airlock that protruded from its prefabricated construction. In this way, it was like every other building in Crossroads. A vintage cast iron sign hung from the top, illuminated by the buzzing white street lamps. \"The Ebonsteel Pony,\" which had the visage of the eponymous pony, was fashioned from the dark, enchanted steel.",[149,298,299],{},"When the exterior hatch opened with a hiss, Torinn and a few others shuffled inside. The hatch closed behind them, and he worked off his mask and took some deeper, unrestricted breaths. The interior was a small metal room with another doorway on the other side. It was lined with lockers and a few benches, where many of the patrons deposited rebreathers and protective gear. Two green glowstrips lit the room faintly from above.",[149,301,302],{},"Someone hit the button to cycle the airlock, and the background electrical hum climbed pitch to a whine. The smell of sterilizing agents assaulted the nose and left a lingering chemical taste on the back of the tongue. The lights turned red momentarily, and the whine grew louder; a couple of occupants covered their ears. Within a minute, the process was complete, and the interior door popped open into a bustling bar.",[149,304,305],{},"The persistent mechanical noise of the airlock was replaced by music and raised conversation. A woman with horns like a ram was singing and playing a guitar, accompanied by backing music from a soundboard. It was upbeat, folksy, and reminded him of the sort of music his kids would like. Many of the patrons ignored the music, but a decent crowd had gathered around her. Her melody carried to the rest over an internal sound system. The bar goers were a mix of locals and travelers of all different shapes and sizes.",[149,307,308],{},"No one paid Torinn any mind as he made his way through the central room. He bumped past several others, apologizing each time, and always checking his pockets after. He'd grown to distrust crowds. The noisy squall drowned half-remembered instructions of where he was supposed to go.",[149,310,311],{},"The music stopped, and over the speakers came the singer's voice, \"Thank you, thank you. I've been Natasha Irinde! You've been great, but I've gotta get out of here before curfew.\" Drunken boos and calls for an encore. \"Okayyy fine! You all are incorrigible!\" She tuned the instrument. \"I've got one more for you all. It's a favorite for true Astaelians! About a cowardly nobleman who abandoned his city. A man by the name of Lord Varan.\"",[149,313,314],{},"Torinn's heart sank deep in the recesses of his chest. He knew what song she meant. The crowd was ecstatic. She grinned and pumped her arms to hype them up, \"Oh you all know it? Great! Sing along with me! It's called The Lord of Nothing. \" Half the bar joined her.

The walls muffled the sound, but not well enough. He remembered his calming techniques. Not much help. Fascist fucking dogs all over this godless town. He needed to get to where he was going. Seeing a set of three doors, he made a judgement based on the placement of the alley, and tried his luck with the rightmost one.",[149,353,354],{},"He was right. The door swung open revealing the diminutive frame and irisless golden eyes of his employer, an elek named Gallin'Vir. He wore a light grey business suit a few steps too formal for the setting, complemented with a vintage bowler hat that covered strawberry blonde hair.",[149,356,357],{},"The small man's long, rounded ears perked up, and he adjusted a pair of antiquated spectacles. He didn't waste time on formalities. \"You're a quarter-hour late.\" The tempo of his speech was rapid, but Torinn had learned to keep up.",[149,359,360],{},"Torinn stepped into the private room as quickly as he could and half slammed the door. \"I ran a little long. Was checking the exits on the place and got caught up-\" He stopped himself. \"It doesn't matter. Place is as secure as we can ask for. We can leave out of the back just fine...\" He gestured to the miniature airlock on the far wall of the room. \"Where are they?\"",[149,362,363],{},"\"Also late.\" Gallin'Vir's rapid cadence was burdened with a layer of annoyance. \"You smell like smoke. Are you high?\"",[149,365,366],{},"Torinn raised an eyebrow, \"When's the last time you saw me get high? Just polyspice.\" He looked around the room; like the rest of the building, it was constructed mostly of metal, though they hadn't bothered to wallpaper it. Most of the space was taken up by a large round table. A single suspended light bulb without a shade cast sickly white light over the walls, adding to the discomfort. Apparently they were displacing a weekly poker game.",[149,368,369],{},"\"Still, you shouldn't be smoking with your-\" Gallin'Vir stopped halfway through.. \"Never mind. Are we ready?\"",[149,371,372],{},"\"Up to you.\" Habit dictated Torinn check his weapon. He unholstered it and did a quick once over. It was a revolver with two firing chambers, one stacked on top of the other, a Jerris Model X. Firing both barrels kicked like a mule and required wrist augmentation for safety, but it was a cherished gift from his wife. He confirmed it was loaded and put it back.",[149,374,375],{},"The two of them made conversation while they waited. Plans for their return back east. Torinn's experience in this region. Gallin'Vir's work. 10 turned to 11, and 11 turned to midnight with still no sign of the people they were waiting to meet. At some point, Gallin'Vir started pacing.

He gritted his teeth and clutched his right hip. He pushed the now dead jackal off of him and looked to the fresh wound. The shotgun grazed his hip — shallow wounds, but bloody.

No trouble would follow.",[149,526,527],{},"Settled in their private car, Torinn gnashed his teeth as the last scattershot pellet was removed from his side. It was a flesh wound, but no amount of getting shot was ever really acceptable. Gallin'Vir opened up his bag, revealing vials, bottles, and composite flasks that each glowed and glittered different colors. Torinn knew these were tools of a trade, but they seemed wondrous all the same. The small doctor took out a cloth, some cleaning solution, and a vial filled with a glittering red liquid marked \"YF\".",[149,529,530],{},"Torinn was shirtless and glanced out the interior window to make sure no one could see. He was in exceptional shape for his age, with extra broad shoulders that flattered his above-average height. Regardless, he had a classical sense of modesty.

He worked fast, wiping down and cleaning the wound expertly.",[149,532,533],{},"Gallin'Vir uncorked the glass vial. \"This will sting,\" he cautioned, though Torinn knew how this went. A couple of drops fell onto his wound, and the alchemist massaged them into the torn skin. Torinn bit his forearm to keep from crying out. Instead, he let out a low, pained grunt as the flesh began to stitch itself back together. Within half a minute, the wound was closed. All that remained was a bulging bit of irritated flesh. \"Looks to be healing well. Don't pick at it, and it will be gone within the hour.\"",[149,535,536],{},"Torinn nodded and thanked his healer. Yender's Formula was a marvel, but uncomfortable. One's flesh and muscle repairing itself at that speed blended the sensation of burning and electrical tingling. At the very least, Gallin'Vir was adept at his craft. Torinn had received much worse treatment. He still had a bit of trouble moving his left shoulder after a botched application in the war.",[149,538,539],{},"The alchemist made eye contact with him. The iris-less eyes of an elek were hard to focus on, but he met the gaze. \"Have these been spreading?\" Gallin'Vir's hand pointed at the discolored patches of skin across Torinn's torso.",[149,541,542],{},"Torinn tightened his lips and nodded, \"Like you said they would.\" Thinking about it reminded him of the irritation in his lungs, and he coughed a few times into his hand.",[149,544,545],{},"Gallin'Vir frowned and thought for a second, \"Take your medicine as normal. I'll look at some alterations to your prescription when we're back in the city.\"",[149,547,548],{},"Torinn nodded, stood up, and retrieved his travel bag. He grabbed his brown button-up from the floor, noting the damage. He'd see about getting it patched up. He could just go to a department store, but he'd had this one for longer than he could remember. He folded it, stuffed it in the bag, and put on a simple black tee he kept for emergencies.",[149,550,551],{},"He sat back down and looked out the window. A destroyed landscape sped by. The wasteland was a vast stretch of ash and jagged rock formations that carried on into the Alura Desert out west. Further out from that was the foot of the Kavan mountain range. If one looked closely in the moonlight, they could see it dotted with mutated plant life, ruins of civilizations before, and small settlements. Then the nagging memory manifested in the words and song of the bar musician. Somewhere out there, beyond view, was a hole in the world. What remained of Varanskeep, his home.",[149,553,554],{},"He kept staring, and the mechanical rhythm of the train's motion lulled him into a sort of trance. This carried on for what could have been hours, broken when Gallin'Vir began talking to himself.",[149,556,557],{},"The elek had opened one of the packages: the canister. It was metal, with a prominent dent in the side. He reached into the container and pulled out a round, snub tube made of brass and glass. At one end of its structure, Torinn noticed a small switch. An engraved arrow pointed to what looked like a cap.",[149,559,560],{},"\"Power cell?\" he guessed and then felt dumb. It felt too obvious. He shifted his question. \"Is it alright?\"",[149,562,563],{},"Gallin'Vir stopped mumbling, and his head darted up. After a second to process, he nodded, \"Yes, yes. The container absorbed the impact. No fuel, as expected. No reason to think this would be volatile. \" He went back to looking down and took out a small black rectangle of metal and glass. He thumbed a button on the side and began tapping on its surface. The dataslate was Gallin'Vir's preferred notebook.",[149,565,566],{},"Torinn let out a long sigh and grabbed a flask filled with brandy from his bag.

Perhaps some kind of divine justice, to be made to serve in the twilight of his life.",[149,571,572],{},"A grim laugh — the humor wasn't lost on him. He knew how lucky he was, compared to many others, especially among the pre-Empire nobility. Gallin'Vir was doing important work, even if few other people realized it. Torinn's family had heavily instilled the virtues of history. Even past superstition, he saw the value. The Parathan had nearly conquered the world. So much was accomplished. Their advances in the science of alchemy had built the modern world, without doubt.",[149,574,575],{},"Of course, all empires fall, and the Parathan fell spectacularly. \"The Judgement\" came. First, a cataclysmic earthquake that shook the whole of Vian, killing millions. Next, almost the whole world was buried in ash and rock upon a volcanic eruption from the supervolcano Draiskaln, followed by every other active eruption site on the planet. The mortals of Vian survived, just barely, but the old Empire was mortally wounded. It would collapse within the year. So much was lost.",[149,577,578],{},"Gallin'Vir's profession was finding the things that were lost when they fell.",[149,580,581],{},"Torinn used this for assurance. They were doing good.

Good time, all things considered. The platform crowded with tired people as they shambled out of the cozy train into the bitter air of the night. Many fumbled to put on rebreathers as they moved on to their connecting trains, or out to the nearest town. Gallin'Vir said he had a message to send at the communications station, privately. He assured Torinn they'd meet in time for their departure. The bodyguard lamented the separation, but knew when his charge made a decision, it was final.",[149,608,609],{},"He sprung to alert when shouts came from the adjacent platform. A bulky, 8-foot tall reptilian known as a Primas-ika, and their child had been stopped by metallic yelling from station officers. These officers, military police, wore sealed cobalt blue armor. One of the soldiers demanded to see IDs. Both parent and child pleaded for mercy as guns were waved in their faces. One of the cops pulled on the parent's long braids. The parent cried out and went to pull open their bag, perhaps a little too quickly. They were struck in the face with the butt of a rifle. Another soldier fired into the air and held the gun to the kid's head. The instincts of the other travelers had taken over. The platform cleared in less than a minute.",[149,611,612],{},"All three officers declared their authority in the name of the Empire and screamed for both of the Primas-ikas to get on the ground.

No amount of obedience would have spared them.",[149,614,615],{},"If they were lucky, the parent would walk away with some injuries and a fine. The child would escape with memories of the cruelty that exists in the hearts of some adults. Torinn's fists tightened as he pondered the darker alternatives. Then came the gnawing rage. People were just going to let this happen! How easily he could draw his pistol and take care of things. Surely their Empire wouldn't miss a few enforcers.

Natural?\"",[149,625,626],{},"The young man, one of the relay technicians if Torinn gathered correctly, received the cigarette graciously and took a small puff.

Vivid recollections of the corpse strewn early days of the technology stained his memory. 'Unnatural,' he often thought.",[149,729,730],{},"He knew that this was unfair. The same could be said of most arcane and alchemical technologies. Still, that didn't ease his mind when the large, tubular locomotive came roaring into the station. Upon its fast stop, it released a hiss of vaporized water and chemicals that turned the smell of the air sour even through their masks.",[149,732,733],{},"It was about the size of a normal train, if not a little wider. Outside of the main cars were reinforced, rounded alloy plates that each had \"GT FLASHTRACK\" painted on its hull.",[149,735,736],{},"He looked over to Gallin'Vir, who was staring at the porters loading their luggage. He frowned and stood on the tips of his toes. The flashtrack's setup didn't allow for personal luggage to be carried with the passengers. Torinn set his hand on the smaller man's shoulder. Neither of them said anything. He wasn't the best comfort. Gallin'Vir thanked him with a slight smile anyway.",[149,738,739],{},"Torinn watched as the previous passengers of the train filed out, waiting for their turn to board with similar anticipation to a man awaiting execution. Soon enough, they made their way in. The inside of their car was dark. No windows, per safety regulation. The glowing red thermal light strips on either curve of the rounded rectangular ceiling provided adequate lighting and nothing more. In the stead of individual seats were metal benches with two harnesses and headrests attached to each side.",[149,741,742],{},"Torinn worked on his harness. It made a tight 'X' across his torso. He felt like a trapped animal. He didn't want to be here. Every noise was amplified, the chatter of passengers situated, the clicking of security belts, the slow, burdened clunk… clunk… clunk… of the porters' magboots as they made their way up and down the car checking tickets. It was all deafening.",[149,744,745],{},"He closed his eyes and sighed. When he got anxious he pictured his wife, Salee. Her blonde hair with tasteful streaks of grey, swept into a ponytail. Her kind green eyes. How she'd hold his hand a little tighter than he would expect of hands so fine. How she'd say, \"It's all okay. This will pass.\" He lingered there in the moment, then he felt a sharp prick in his right hand, followed by a rushing coolness into his veins.",[149,747,748],{},"Torinn yelped and opened his eyes in surprise, he looked down to see the syringe that Gallin'Vir had jammed into his hand. He met the elek's orb-like eyes, \"Just a mild sedative,\" he said, with a casualness that suggested drugging someone was the most normal thing in the world. Torinn didn't know whether to be furious or grateful. The sedative kicked in and decided for him. His muscles relaxed and he placed his head back on the rest. Nothing left to do but enjoy the ride.",[149,750,751],{},"A distant call came from outside, and the automatic doors shut. Within five minutes the train was in motion. Departure was slow and normal at first, despite what the accommodations within would suggest. That changed twenty minutes into the trip. A klaxxon buzzed twice, and the flashtrack lurched, throwing the occupants back in their seats. A humming started, slow and almost impossible to perceive above the background noise of the train's motion. Then it turned to a buzzing, and the air took on a blueish hue. A faint stench like hair burning in the distance assaulted his nose..",[149,753,754],{},"From behind he heard a porter walking.

The same place where the Council of The Gods had gathered their first followers, ten souls to spread their influence across the world. The Prophets, who would build their namesake hall on that peak.

A custodial closet, too. At one end of the hall was the entrance they had come in from, at the other was a fork.

Arina looked back at Dotty. “Hey T, got another grenade?”",[149,2554,2555],{},"Feigned offense. “A, I’m a member of the Psreidish Demolitionists Guild in good standing! Are you asking *me* if I have explosives?”",[149,2557,2558],{},"Arina rolled her eyes. “Dumb question. Don’t care.

She stood up first, nodded to Temperance, and rushed out. She ducked and took a few shots. All guesswork: she couldn’t see any better in the gas than they could. Screams from the larger area around them — the glimpse she got from Dotty’s resograph said this chamber was huge.",[149,2594,2595],{},"She eyed a decorative stone wall that went on around the circular room as far as she could see. She slid to it and gave the “clear enough” signal to her avian companion.

They needed to move.",[149,2602,2603],{},"“With me!” She took a couple more shots and led the way. It wasn’t easy to maintain the focus to keep time dilation active, but she was a professional. She tried to ignore how much her eyes hurt.",[149,2605,2606],{},"They cleared the gas and got a view of a beautiful atrium. A titanic round glass window was built into the outer wall, bringing in the natural sunset onto what seemed to be a place full of plant life, surrounded by stone grey flooring and walls. From here, three main exits. Access to the grand lift, some offices with several company names Arina knew and several she didn’t, and a security checkpoint to an area marked only with the image of a bubbling flask, underwritten in future-modern font: “Yender Medical.” Temperance pointed them toward the last one.",[149,2608,1307],{},[149,2610,2611],{},"In front of them, the Yender Medical guards were rallying.

Arina popped up and took a shot at the officer. A lash of energy pierced clean through their chest, and they fell back.

Now, though, it was made orange-red by the emergency lights, flames, and spatters of blood. So uniform, so organized, now bathed in mayhem. This place must have driven people insane. Arina shuddered at the thought of working here. The red was a nice touch, though. Reminded her of a nightclub she liked in Lowtown.",[149,2681,2682],{},"Temperance pointed them left, towards the hallway marked ‘Habitation’.

No time to block the bludgeon the other was swinging at her head. She held her hands to protect her face. Instead a cracking of glass and the stench of flesh being destroyed. It was joined by one of the most hideous screams she’d ever heard in her life. She opened her eyes and saw the bludgeon guard on the ground, clutching his face, half burned off by some hissing chemical agent. “Holy shit.” It was so… real. “Holy shit.” What a gruesome way to die. “Holy shit.”",[149,2699,2700],{},"“Hey, don’t snap on me now, A.” Temperance grabbed her by the arm and pulled her along. “Oh fine, you wipe out a whole fucking squad of these fucks and it’s fine and good.

It creeped her out, but she couldn’t help but smile a half-hearted smile beneath her rebreather. The door they were in front of was marked “Theo’Vir.

One of the nicest beds Arina had ever seen, besides maybe back on the homestead. Warm yellow lights lit what was… actual wood? The Yender corporation didn’t fuck around. There was a desk, a bed, a kitchen, a bathroom, and windows that revealed the purples and oranges of the last glow of day. In the center of it all, in a couch setup in a shallow pit in the floor, was an elek. The person, presumably Theo’Vir, was in very fine lounge clothes.",[149,2715,2716],{},"The occupant spoke first. Either he was completely calm, or he had a really good face for playing cards. “Now listen, I don’t know what you’re here for, but I’m certain I can find something-” His accent was slight, but unmistakably Inerlesian.",[149,2718,2719],{},"“The journal.” Arina tried to make her voice lower and bigger. It wasn’t convincing.",[149,2721,2722],{},"“Oh. So *she* sent you.” He made no effort to contain his disgust. He stood up and walked towards his desk.",[149,2724,2725],{},"Confusion. “He… Gallin’Vir.”",[149,2727,2728],{},"Theo’Vir sighed, “Listen, I don’t care who you want to take your money from.

A woman’s a woman.”",[149,2730,2731],{},"He produced a hard case from a locked drawer and handed it to Arina. “The contents within are very fragile. Please, do be careful.” Arina wrenched it out of his hand and looked away, her face red.",[149,2733,2734],{},"Temperance had stepped forward, “One more thing.” They held out an ornate vial of dark green liquid. “Gallin’Vir’s regards.” In their other hand, a pistol that Arina hadn’t seen earlier.",[149,2736,1453],{},[149,2738,2739],{},"“T?” Arina was more surprised than concerned. Theo’Vir was awful, surely, but no one had told her this was a hit job.",[149,2741,2742],{},"The Yasre gave her a look as if to say “not now.” What they further tried to convey, unsuccessfully, was “Don’t you see how clearly this bastard deserves it?”",[149,2744,2745],{},"“So… it’s like that.” Inerlesians had a sense of honor about these sorts of things. Theo’Vir had two choices, he was dead either way.",[149,2747,2748],{},"The Director of Parathan Research walked towards his bed, slipped off his shoes, and drank the vial. “They’re not going to let her control the family fault. Inerlesian civilization is ruled by real men. Not pretenders, not frauds.” He lay down and closed his eyes. “Wretched disgrace,” were his last words. He choked on his liquifying insides and died.",[149,2750,1468],{},[149,2752,2753],{},"A sea of shouts and orders echoed towards them. Unlikely they were getting out the way they came, and here wouldn’t be safe much longer. Arina looked to her comrade, “T?”",[149,2755,2756],{},"“A minute, please. Ritual must be observed…” They paused their sentence to finish the prayer and add an amen. When they concluded, they produced a glowing orange capsule. The commotion was getting closer. Another prayer, and the capsule was broken open on Theo’Vir’s body. The body burst into flames that wondrously didn’t spread to the bed. The smell of a burnt corpse was strong even through their masks. In another life, well before Arina had known them, Temperance had been a priest of Death. Burners, they were often called. They still held their old practices in reverence.",[149,2758,2759],{},"Ritual observed and the spirit of the dead released, Temperance made quick strides to the windowed wall on bouncing avian legs. They started placing sticky explosives on the wall near the window. “You got something, T?” Arina asked, trying to purge the last few minutes from her mind. She didn’t even know there were still people who felt like *that.* She signed up to grab a book. She’d killed before, but no one had said this was a hit job.",[149,2761,2762],{},"Temperance took cover behind the couches, she did too. The explosives went off, and the howling open air tore through the space, papers from the desk swirled in the wind and blew outside. Another explosion shook the floor, Something had been destabilized. The Psried stood up and produced a spray canister from their bag.",[149,2764,2765],{},"They screamed over the wind that ripped papers and loose objects out of the tower. “So, current and only plan. You know how they used to fire people out of artillery back in your all’s war?”",[149,2767,2768],{},"Arina nodded. “My dad was in one of those units!”",[149,2770,2771],{},"“Well, this was meant to replace that. Didn’t get much field testing, though. But it *should* work.” They glanced at the kilometers-long drop down, and the environmental shield they would have to clear. “Okay, it might work. Probably. Maybe.”",[149,2773,2774],{},"Arina looked at the unfathomable distance below. How far up were they? “That’s fucking crazy.”",[149,2776,2777],{},"Another explosion shook the floor, this one more intense than any before. They had to brace themselves. Voices outside the door. Temperance looked toward the entrance, to the improvised exit, and back to her. “Got any better moves?”",[149,2779,2780],{},"Arina didn’t. She shook her head. “Fine. Sounds rad anyway.” She tried to convince herself that things that scared her were cool. She held out her hand to spray, but first they handed her a pill. “You won’t be able to breathe. This will help.”",[149,2782,2783],{},"She took the pill with apprehension, but she trusted her partner, her comrade. What other assurances did they have, if not each other? They embraced once more, and then Temperance began to apply the spray. It covered her person and began hardening like a stone. She couldn’t see it, but it expanded around her into a rough egg-shaped pod. The Yasre was right, she couldn’t breathe, but she didn’t need to. It was freaky.

The smoke cloud that filled my lungs was thick and harsh, accented with a citrus twinge. I held my breath and stared upward. From my rooftop, I had a perfect view of the glittering amethyst hexagons that made up the dome-shaped environmental shield. It always gave you something pretty to look at when you tilted your head up. Above it, a rolling tide of grey clouds with orange blots where the persevering dawn struggled to break through. I frowned slightly, it was another dreary day.",[149,2837,2838],{},"I exhaled a little too late and coughed for ten seconds at least. My vision went white and the sounds of morning dissolved into a dizzy, oxygen-deprived hum. I glanced around in a half-high, half-conscious haze, worried I had made a scene in front of a neighbor. Of course, no one was up there that early. My mornings on top of Pier 17’s stacks were usually solitary, and I liked it that way. ",[149,2840,2841],{},"I took another drag of the joint, it was a decent blend. Most heavier drugs didn’t work on me, because of my condition. This strain was homegrown by one of my neighbors, Uri. She was former clergy, and the naturalistic botany she practiced in service of Drais, The Gardener produced a smokable plant that my system could process, unlike the synthetics carried in most stores. Buying from her guaranteed an extra hour of conversation, but sometimes I learned something about church life. I took one more drag, put the joint out, coughed again, and blinked slowly. My vision was a little blurrier and my mind drifted a little. I closed my eyes.",[149,2843,2844],{},"I reached into my pocket and grabbed a small stone. I closed my palm around it, and began to murmur prayers. I prayed for the usual things. I prayed for my parents back east, for money, for good health, and for good fortune on the next excursion- that sort of thing. Then I sat in silence, listening to the beating of water against the concrete dock and the distant caws of a port raven. ",[149,2846,2847],{},"In the stillness, I began looking at the scene through the lens of an imagined resograph. Not a detailed image, but rather the very threads of reality that wrapped around it all. I saw the rectangular outlines of every tower of makeshift apartments and the expanse of the city beyond them. I saw my place, its roof, and the little nook I had worked so hard to make for myself. At the center was a girl with one arm, fairly tall even when kneeling, with a bowed head. She was Alice Talin. She was me. Moments of peace had been rare recently, but from this point of view, it didn’t seem so bad. ",[149,2849,2850],{},"A couple of shouts from the street below pulled me back into reality. I opened my eyes and peeked over the roof’s edge. The neighborhood kids were out early, playing some variant of a tag game. I chuckled. I wasn’t old by any means but I couldn’t fathom having that much energy.",[149,2852,2853],{},"I unfolded my hand and glanced at the stone. It was teal, with a compass icon etched into its face. An icon of St. Kathen, the Pathfinder. My mother gave this to me when I turned 13 ‘so I would always find my way back to her’.

A former storage container converted into a tight 1 bedroom, the same as the rest of Pier 17. I kicked down the folded stairs and made a careful descent. The hatch’s seal hissed behind me, a little strained. I’d need to replace the tubing soon. I did the cost calculation in my head and felt a knot form in my stomach. Money was never easy, but medical expenses had left things tighter than usual. ",[149,2861,2862],{},"I set the prayer bundle down in its spot and flipped on the radio, tuned to Dr. Swell’s talk show. Swell, an energetic DJ on a pirate frequency, had a bent for conspiracy theories. He was rambling on about a discrepancy in caravan records. He claimed this proved that the Empire of Astael was making traders disappear. I didn’t know anything about it, but it wouldn’t be surprising if true. I continued, half listening as I got dressed for the day. I had work later.",[149,2864,2865],{},"For someone with my condition, jobs are hard to come by. I couldn’t receive the chemical surgeries required to get specialized work, and even normal jobs were harder without the ability to metabolize potions.

If you needed something recovered from the wastelands, and you couldn’t turn to legitimate means, you hired a contractor from the underworld Community. If the Community wouldn’t touch the job, you called someone like Oren to find help. At the end of this chain of channels and backchannels were freelance scavengers like me. Scavvers, they’d call us. People brave– or desperate enough to go into the wastelands alone.  ",[149,2870,2871],{},"Yesterday, I got word via a messenger drone that Oren had work for me. I was expected to leave the city by the end of the day. I slipped on a simple shirt and pants, earthy colors. I had tucked the joint behind my ear while I worked on my jacket. Genuine leather was expensive, but my parents enjoyed modest wealth. They had it dyed a patriotic purple and had a gold gryphon sewn into the right shoulder, standard colors for Astael’s now-defunct Royal Army. They were so proud the day I enlisted.

I had some gloves, climbing gear, a first aid kit, a space heater, and wind-shielded tenting in case I had to spend the night outside of the city’s border. Then of course the complex mix of metal bars, screws, and wiring that made up my crossbow. The weapon’s metal frame was collapsed and bundled into a metal rectangle with some bolts covered in electrical wiring. Finally, a rebreather; a small metal mask that wrapped around the face. A must-have for open-air exposure - even in the city only the foolhardy walked without one. My kit was simple as most scavvers went, but traveling light kept me nimble.",[149,2882,2883],{},"I packed up my things and slung the bag over my shoulder. I began to move toward the door but remembered to feed the fish first. When the food hit their water, the three of them shifted to a pleasant magenta, and they began to feast. I flipped the switch on the light and stumbled my way through my dark apartment. Furniture had to be inventively placed in a space as small as this, and walking it blind was an exercise in memory.",[149,2885,2886],{},"At the front hatch, I pressed the unseal button and waited for it to depressurize. I winced as my eyes adjusted to the brightness of the hazy morning. The cloud cover was heavy enough that it didn’t take long, but for a moment everything seemed so bright. I was now outside, on top of the scaffolding that stretched alongside rows and columns of improvised housing that stretched along the docks. I’d seen one of my neighbors take a nasty spill on a rusted-out step, so I always went down slowly. Inspectors didn’t often make their way out here.",[149,2888,2889],{},"I passed by Old Man Rorik, sitting with his airlock open and horn music coming from inside the unit. He gave me a nod and a smile but didn’t say much else. We were a neighborhood, but a lot of us kept to ourselves. Most of us preferred it that way. ",[149,2891,2892],{},"Overall, I enjoyed my time there, and it was as affordable as New Bekton went. Some rent control policies from the old administration were still in effect. My unit was one of the cheapest in the city, which worked for my strange and inconsistent income. My landlord was as nice as a housing baron could be, he even cut a hundred off my rent when he learned I was a former Royalist. There weren’t many friends of the Empire in this ring of the city. ",[149,2894,2895],{},"At the bottom of the scaffolding, the dock was a mix of mercrete and metal plating. New Bekton was a city on an island, which placed a limit on its growth. To avoid unnecessary infrastructure spending, the old Royal government sanctioned a group of piers to become emergency housing. That was 70 years ago, and any chance of a permanent solution under the new Imperial government was even less likely than under those before them. Pier 17 a fact of life. It wasn’t always the worst thing that it was. ",[149,2897,2898],{},"I crossed the dock to a group of skimmers. Vehicles that resembled a larger brass tube and a smaller steel tube fused together. Some of my neighbors were rich enough to own one of them, sectioned off in a private parking lot. Otherwise, the floating cars were the property of the Wakenfern Transit Authority. I picked the one closest to me and got inside. The interior was fairly simple, with a bit of graffiti on the dash. Certainly, it was clean and comfortable enough, albeit barebones. The radio worked, and that was enough for me.",[149,2900,2901],{},"I flipped to Dr. Swell’s show, now interviewing an ash farmer. I caught the conversation in the middle so I didn’t entirely get what was happening, but it seemed that they were discussing the ethics of a new alchemical pesticide used on ash yams. Specifically, its effect on the wine supply. Yam wine was a wasteland staple, the segment would do quite well. ",[149,2903,2904],{},"I reached for the ignition, a hole a couple of inches wide next to the control stick. I stuck my left finger in and winced as the needle pierced my skin. I withdrew my finger and held it tight while the machine processed my reading. I had registered when I got my license, like most kids. It would reference my genetic material and charge it to my account. I couldn’t remember my balance but I was certain I had enough for the day.  ",[149,2906,2907],{},"The simple dashboard display scrolled a “Welcome” to an old name I mentally blurred out. “Enjoy your ride!” and the vehicle hummed to life. I buckled in and flipped the brake lock. With a slight lurch, the skimmer lifted off the ground, orienting with me in the brass passenger tube on top, and the propulsion tube on bottom. I did a quick check for other vehicles, drone traffic, and everything else they train you to be worried about in flight school. I pulled the stick and began the climb to travel altitude. ",[149,2909,222],{},[149,2911,2912],{},"From the aerial vantage point, it became apparent why New Bekton was called The City of Rings. The island city was comprised of three tiered circles, ascending towards the center. The messy outer ring, Lowtown, is where I had spent most of my adult life. The middle ring, Midtown, was corporations, entertainment, and academia. Government and religious institutions centered in the highest Uptown ring. At the center of it all was a massive spire that shot past the environmental shield, the cloudline, the sky, and into the void, thus named the Voidspire. Lights were everywhere, and the airspace was smothered with traffic. The city strained against its island constraints, but somehow there was always a little more room for another development. ",[149,2914,2915],{},"Different parts of the city had their own unique energies. Pier 17 was a fairly chill place where people lay low. The same could be said of the adjacent South Lowtown, which had other low-income housing. North Lowtown was different. It was no nicer than any other part of the outer ring. The affluent parts of the city were the middle and center. However, the people in North Lowtown were hungrier than their southern counterparts. They had more drive. A day in the North Lowtown shops was always a pleasure.",[149,2917,2918],{},"I left my rental at another rental station and started walking. I kept my head down to avoid the constant stream of poster ads, something you learned to do if you wanted to get through a walk on city streets without a panic attack. I stayed close to the sidewalk's edge, doing my best to stay out of the way. Several buildings on the street had been closed down in a police raid. I craned my neck and looked for uniforms. Imperial blues, not New Bekton Law Enforcement olive. They were grabbing people for questioning. Best to get moving quickly. I darted a sharp right down the recently renamed Courage Lane, part of the new admin’s initiative to promote patriotism. ",[149,2920,2921],{},"There were a few nice businesses here, I often went down Courage to shop on an off day. The Azure Cat bar played soft Nur Fasaani folk music out of its opened airlock to my left. A young woman with spliced-on gills and a clipboard started to talk to me about corp recruitment. I made that hand gesture that was polite enough to acknowledge the person but firmly communicated “Not today.” My eyes wandered over a couple of pop-up market stalls that called to passersby on the right. I eyed a particularly cute doll in one of their displays, but the pathetic jingle in my coin purse reminded me that I didn’t have enough money for a detour. I frowned, then shrugged. Those stalls hiked up their prices anyway. The shop I needed lay just beyond.",[149,2923,2924],{},"Korvun’s Finest Apothecary was an unassuming old house that had been converted into a storefront through some questionably legal remodeling. Zealously placed signs advertised it as “New Bekton’s premier apothecarium.” They often opened late so I was hoping I had not come too early. The flashing “Open” sign rewarded my faith. I pressed the bright red button on the airlock and waited for it to cycle. These commercial ones were required to be larger than personal units like the one on the front of my place, unsealing them often took longer. ",[149,2926,2927],{},"The airlock opened and I entered into a small waiting room with a bunch of lockers and seats.  Most commercial buildings were required to offer shelter in the event of environmental shield failure. The interior chamber of the airlock had the painted image of a small plant rising out of a pile of dirt, colorful little bulbs hinting at fruit to come. It was a cute logo, I figured the shopkeeper's child made it, apparently, they were going for an art degree at the city’s premier University. ",[149,2929,2930],{},"Inside, the storefront was arranged to promote serenity. There was no overhead lighting. Instead, what illumination there was came from the interior lining of glass cases filled with plants. The lights were a celadon green, and cast a vibrant glow across the room, a thematic attempt at representing moonlight. In the shadows, menacingly lit by the lowered lighting was a tall and lumbering figure. I heard the metal floor thud and clack with heavy clawed steps as they approached me. ",[149,2932,2933],{},"I smiled and looked up, they were a couple of feet taller than me. “Morning Haela!” I said warmly. Haela was good people. They were a Primas-ika, tall and bulky reptiles. Their scales were a light grey but shone green in the light. Their curved horns were slightly outlined and the gold caps on them reflected a little shine, and their long false hair was braided around their shoulders. Haela smiled, revealing a mouth full of glistening sharp teeth. “Alice, my girl! How’s your week been?”",[149,2935,2936],{},"“Ah you know how it is, a couple jobs here and there. How’s the shop?”",[149,2938,2939],{},"This exchange was fairly routine. We talked about our days, my days in Pier 17, my social life, their work, their child’s career, and more. Haela began to retrieve my usual medication. They pulled out a couple of jars of different colored herbs and began to powder them up with an old-fashioned mortar and pestle. I enjoyed Haela’s shop for the focus on artisanal craftship at fairly reasonable prices. What’s more, not many people were experts on my condition, especially ones that I could afford without insurance.",[149,2941,2942],{}," “So…” Haela signaled the change in subject to more direct business, “Have you been spending more time outside the shield?”",[149,2944,2945],{},"The dim light of the room hid me from paling. We were doing this again, “Yeah, professional requirement.”",[149,2947,2948],{},"Haela’s sharpened teeth made a hissing sound of admonishment, “You shouldn’t be out there.”",[149,2950,2951],{},"“I know, I-”",[149,2953,2954],{},"They continued without pause. “The wildlife and other hazards aside, the air alone will corrode your lungs.”",[149,2956,2957],{},"“I wear a rebreather, Haela.” I tried to give a thoughtful smile. Haela was a kind soul, just opinionated. ",[149,2959,2960],{},"The aged Primas-ika laughed, “Bah, rebreathers. Do you think a waster wears a mask every day and doesn’t look different when cut open? At least they have tinctures and cleansing pills. You’ve only got the-” They stopped to count. “Two, two lungs my girl!”",[149,2962,2963],{},"I stammered, “Haela, I- I- I get it. Thank you for looking out for me but it’s what I’m doing for now.” I wanted to defend myself, say I was good at it, say that it made me feel alive. I chose to leave it at the assurance. ",[149,2965,2966],{},"Haela sighed, “Of course. I’m going to add some Moran’s Root to your supplements. It promotes respiratory health. Take a double dose when you’re out in the wastes. You’re 27 right?”",[149,2968,2969],{},"“Yes,” I was surprised they remembered, I was only vaguely aware that they were in their 50s. ",[149,2971,2972],{},"“It’s been a while since medical school, but if I recall, humans stop replenishing cells at a positive rate around that age. Most folks would just take a regen potion but…” They paused thoughtfully as if deciding something internally. They moved on from the thought, grabbed a handful of a root, and shaved off a few flecks into the gathered ingredients before them.",[149,2974,2975],{},"“I get you.” I nodded.  “Maybe I’ll win the lottery and kick it in Nur Fasaan.” We both did that little small talk laugh where nothing said was very funny but we were trying to keep it light. I appreciated Haela, they had been my go-to since I could make my own medical decisions. ",[149,2977,2978],{},"People with Nuralis Syndrome don’t tend to live long. It was rare, one in ten thousand humans was born without the ability to process advanced alchemy and augmentations. The things that kept most city-dwellers healthy without natural sunlight or good food sources. Doctors didn’t give me long. I wasn’t supposed to live long past 20. The gods had been kind to me, and I tried to repay that gift with my service when I could. ",[149,2980,2981],{},"My parents had been protective of me growing up, I wasn’t allowed to do much because they were worried I’d get hurt in some way that I couldn’t fix without a potion. Though they were proud of me for signing onto the Astaelian Royal Army, they had frequently urged me to take a support role. They went overseas during the war and never found out about my arm. I almost bled out because the medic didn’t know how to apply normal bandaging without a healing salve to seal the wound. ",[149,2983,2984],{},"Haela would sometimes check the scar and apply ointments and creams to try to return the skin to normal. They were the closest thing to a doctor I could see; most wouldn’t know what to do with me. Without the ability to integrate into chemical society most people with Nuralis Syndrome were left on the edge of civilization. “Organics” they called us because we were more or less the same as the day we were born. ",[149,2986,2987],{},"Haela finished mixing the bowl and started pouring it into a small machine that placed the blend into small pills. When done, it produced a bottle of a month’s worth of supplements and vitamins. They looked up at me, “Do you have enough hormones?”",[149,2989,2990],{},"I thought about it, and shrugged, “No harm in stocking up.” Gender transition for most people was as simple as a specially prepared drink or a salve. Some chemically assisted surgery here and there. I wasn’t so lucky, I had to rely on direct hormone replacement and old-fashioned surgical techniques. It was my life, though. I liked living, and it wasn’t like I was going to give up my identity. Haela was great for that too, with old-school know-how and the biolab they had in the back.",[149,2992,2993],{},"By most observations, I was healthier than most organics and I credited that to the apothecary’s amazing work. They were not cheap, which I was reminded of as I handed a small pile of crystalline coins to Haela. They did the math, made changes, and we said our goodbyes. On the way out I stopped by the little shrine to Iudan, The Healer. I whispered a small prayer of thanks for the bounty. Haela went back to work and I slipped out the door. ",[149,2995,2996],{},"I walked out of Haela’s shop’s airlock and popped one of the pills. I washed it down with my canteen. The hormones I’d need to take at home with one of my syringes. I stood off to the side of the stoop and lit my joint again. Natural hemp was in no way addictive, but I relied on it to drown out a background radiation of anxiety that came with the fast-paced New Bekton life. I took my first drag and exhaled into the air as pedestrians avoided me. For all the faults of the new Imperial government, they had eased restrictions on public smoking in the city-states, which was fine by me. ",[149,2998,2999],{},"Then I heard it. “Adrian!” I stopped dead. “Adrian!” the voice repeated in my direction. I looked around, hoping they meant someone else. In a panic my neck whipped around, looking for the source. I reached for a pistol that wasn’t on my hip. My breathing was fast. I cursed my illness, that I couldn’t transition like others, with their fancy chems and surgeries. I cursed myself for forgetting to shave that morning and wearing such a masculine jacket. I cursed the gods that would put me in this wretched form and insist I live with it. One last time I heard it, like the invocation of some kind of old and vile magick, “Adrian!” ",[149,3001,3002],{},"I located the voice, an elek standing about 5 feet tall. He had prematurely grey hair, those trademark irisless brass eyes most of the species had, and long, rounded ears studded with earrings that protruded half a foot from either side of his head. He was doing the thing that eleks do where they stand on the tips of their toes and ponder the situation. Then the recognition clicked. I knew this man. He cocked his head and slightly frowned, I could see him reacting to the look on my face, and considering if he had made an error. He carefully and apologetically, “So sorry ma’am, I think there was a misunderstanding.”",[149,3004,3005],{},"Panic and rage washed over into relief and joy, “Tar’Il?” I said though the voice that came from me is not the one he probably remembered. He perked up, “A-” he stopped himself, and considered the situation. I was just glad this was a friendly face, the worst-case scenarios that had been flooding my mind drifted away. “Alice, my name is Alice now. It’s been years Tar’il!” I was smiling, in part because it helps cis people feel comfortable after an incident, but also because I was just so happy to see him. ",[149,3007,3008],{},"“No shit!” Tar’il laughed. “How’ve you been? Is this where you’re holing up these days?” ",[149,3010,3011],{},"“Yeah, I live over in the Pier 17 development. Cheap waterfront property. Landlord’s nephew was another violetcoat.”",[149,3013,3014],{},"“Another Royalist! Good on him! You know what battalion?” ",[149,3016,3017],{},"I frowned and looked away, “The 21st.” ",[149,3019,3020],{},"“Oh…” Tar’il trailed off for a second too. Everyone knew what became of the 21st at the end of the war. After that mournful instant Tar’Il tried to recover. “Well hey, I was just about to head to a Hungry Reihn’s a couple blocks down. You want a bite? I’m buying.”",[149,3022,3023],{},"I rolled my eyes, “Do you live here?”",[149,3025,3026],{},"“No no, just visiting.”",[149,3028,3029],{},"“Of course you are, that’s tourist food. Come on, there’s a cute little cafe that just opened up on Victory Boulevard.”",[149,3031,3032],{},"We spent the next couple of hours catching up. We talked about our time in the war, my arm, our old CO. We had been in the same unit for a time. After the Royalists lost most of us scattered to the wind. Most of us took our skills wherever we could get paid. Tar’Il was in town for work, and we had been luckily in the same place at the same time. ",[149,3034,3035],{},"He said he worked in security and I said I worked in reclamation and we kept it at that. It was best to not ask questions about these sorts of things. We discussed the completion of the Voidspire, and how New Bekton had gone from a port town to a tech hub in just a decade. The sorts of conversations you have with an old friend you know you won’t see again for a long time. ",[149,3037,3038],{},"When we left the cafe, Tar’Il pulled me aside. We stood by the side door of the cafe in an alley. Tar’Il waited for a drone to pass by overhead, then looked at me. “So, you keep up with the Front at all?”",[149,3040,3041],{}," That cold headrush of disappointment hit me as I realized what was happening.",[149,3043,3044],{},"He continued, “We could use someone like you, Alice. Not even out there in the wastes, we need fighters right here in New Bekton!” He gestured to the Imperial drone floating away, and whispered, “You think these fuckers are gonna go away on their own?”",[149,3046,3047],{},"“I don’t do that anymore Tar, and I don’t appreciate the feeling that you just wanted to give the sales pitch.”",[149,3049,3050],{},"He held his mouth open as he thought of what to say, Eleks were usually fast with their words but he was clearly trying to be careful. “Alice no- I- I’m so glad to see you. I’m in town to do some work for them. I can’t tell you what.”",[149,3052,3053],{},"“I know.” I nodded reassuringly.",[149,3055,3056],{},"“Things are just bad out there, we need people like you.”",[149,3058,3059],{},"“Tar, dear, I’ve had this talk before with others from the unit. I respect what you’re doing but the answer’s no.” I gave that disarming smile again. ",[149,3061,3062],{},"“You’re a good one, Alice. Don’t let the wasteland life turn you sour.”",[149,3064,3065],{},"“Hasn’t yet,” and we laughed, clasped arms, and said our goodbyes. He gave me the address of his hotel in case I needed to get in touch, but we both knew that this was probably the last time we’d see each other for a while. ",[149,3067,3068],{},"I think a lot about that encounter. How just by happenstance we had been in the same district at the same time. How New Bekton pushes people together by making itself a necessity. It was the last time I got to talk to him. He was executed at an Imperial checkpoint a couple of months later. ",[149,3070,3071],{},"When my mind wanders I start wishing I had said more. That I told him how much his camaraderie meant to me, even if we didn’t keep in touch. Maybe I could have told him that the girl I was fucking makes fake licenses and IDs. Maybe he could have gotten some fake papers for the lash pistol the fascists found in his bag. Would he still be here? Thought exercises, little more. Tar’Il was gone, another proud son of Astael cut down by those who claimed to defend it. ",[149,3073,222],{},[149,3075,3076],{},"There were four main ways out of New Bekton. By boat, in the harbor, was common for commerce and shipping. The new Voidspire went into orbit and connected voidships to stations around the planet. Then there was South-Gate, which was mostly corporate convoys and well-licensed caravans. I was foot traffic, so West-Gate was my usual exit and entrance. ",[149,3078,3079],{},"Customs and Processing had been run by a branch of New Bekton Law Enforcement until recently, part of the Imperial takeover of the city’s operations. Normal business casual attire had been replaced by militarized cobalt blue armor and matching civilian jumpsuits. The environmental shield wrapped into the city’s border wall and its glowing amethyst energy hexagons added a persistent buzzing noise that added to the tension. I caught myself grinding my teeth more than once. Though, maybe that had more to do with the blood-stained wall behind the main office. ",[149,3081,3082],{},"I had my bag on my back and my gear ready. I made sure to stow my Royalist jacket in my pack and was down to my earth tones. My full-face rebreather was buried in my red-brown hair, ready to be brought down quickly.

Oren was expecting my return by 9 AM tomorrow. ",[149,3084,3085],{},"The main office had a booth in its front and guards nearby in any direction. The old human man in front of me had grafted a third leg onto his lower torso that he used to sit.

At one point this would have been twenty minutes, tops. ",[149,3087,3088],{},"An hour later, I was at the front of the line. The clerk was a woman with greying dark hair kept in a tight bun. This part of the exchange was familiar enough. I said my name was Alice Talin, she asked if it was spelled Allis like the god, I corrected and said with a C and an E. I handed over my city ID for reference. She asked my business and I gave it, scavenging was no crime as long as you stayed away from unsanctioned areas. She asked for my license and I paused. This was new. ",[149,3090,3091],{},"“Do you need to check for Class C scavenging?” I went a little outside the drudgery of old power cells and foodstuffs of Class C, but she didn’t know that. ",[149,3093,3094],{},"“New policy, all salvage licenses are processed upon city exit. We confirm transit tickets too. Tamps down on seditionist fraud.”",[149,3096,3097],{},"I clenched my jaw and went into the recesses of my wallet.

One of them drew a gun. I saw the look in the clerk’s eyes, she wanted it to happen. “Handle him,” she waved her hand and threw my IDs back at me. ",[149,3120,3121],{},"A squeaky male voice interjected, “STOP!”",[149,3123,3124],{},"The scene paused, everyone in line behind me, the guards, the clerk, and myself all waiting with bated breath.

For now, you may go.”",[149,3132,3133],{},"The guards let me go, I picked up my IDs in a hurry and scurried towards Norm, who shuttled me towards the gate in time for the 9 pm cycle.

I can’t help you like this again, get your papers in order… it’s only going to get worse.” I nodded and slipped him a 20-piece coin as a thanks.

For a second I could see New Bekton from the outside, how it looked to the world. A city guarded by a dome that looked almost fuschia in the starless night. A city on an island.

Hundreds of years ago they had heralded the age of alchemy that we still lived in. An unsalvaged vehicle could be host to so many rare finds. I’d pay my rent for months.

I froze, feeling my heart nearly pound out of its chest. Random debris? No, that was a trigger. I looked down, staying as still as I could.

Structure and practice hollow of belief. She was in university for mechanics when one of the robed Cyranites handed her a beige tract with red lettering, much like the ones she handed out now.

Something, which she now knew to be the Will of the Council, moved her to attend a meeting. ",[149,3728,3729],{},"The service she attended was unlike anything she had known from a childhood of sitting in pews in stuffy churches.

His augmentation had already been extensive, which was not necessarily unusual. Yet his outlandish visage was hardly what you’d expect from a public speaker. When he spoke, his voice was strained and metallic. Then the words came from his mouth, and she understood. She had never seen such a command of scripture. Holy words resounded from his mouth and blended like music. Indeed many people hummed along. She realized that these words that made up the Writs were not just the writings of scribes, but the voice of the gods. If their words lived on in scripture, how could they be silent?",[149,3734,3735],{},"Mira never looked back. It was hard at first. The enclave demanded tithe upon entry, and she didn’t have much money. She sold her school books, her clothes, her jewelry, anything she could. She knew she would never need them again anyway.

Friends and family she missed, but she had tried to get them to see the light of truth. They could not see, their hearts were blinded. They expressed concern for her, the fools. They couldn’t comprehend the bliss she lived in now. ",[149,3737,3738],{},"More importantly, the work of Father Cyran’s flock was too important. There were no empty promises of salvation.

All the lights were working and the grime on the tiles was minimal. Concrete vaulted ceilings greeted the riders on two sets of tracks. One headed north to south, and the other headed east into the city’s heart. She eyed the crowd carefully. There were so many strange, wonderful people. Many modified by alchemical surgeries. She saw wings, shimmering hair, even some gills. Many were still like her, unaugmented and unassuming, enough for her to blend in. Even the blood stains on her robes weren’t too strange in this rough-and-tumble part of town. ",[149,3772,3773],{},"She got on the northbound platform and halted. She nestled into a corner next to an advertisement for lab-grown vitamins and tried to make herself small.

Not legal in the station, but rarely enforced in the new administration. ",[149,3775,3776],{},"Bestial eyes glanced at her, and a clawed hand passed over the cig. She accepted, though hesitantly, and while fumbling to keep hold of her bag. After all, the Writs said to graciously accept gifts from a noble heart.

She offered him a tract but he politely declined, and they waited in silence.",[149,3778,3779],{},"The gentle buzz brushed against her mind and flushed her cheeks. Its comforting warmth was like the burning of incense, spicy and calming. She leaned against the ad display and for a second realized how tired she was.

She vowed to sleep for a whole week when she returned to the compound. ",[149,3781,3782],{},"The train came squealing into the station and blew a gust of air into her face.

New Bekton’s transportation had been overwhelmed since before Mira was born. She grabbed a hand grip from one of two poles that ran along the rows of seats and clung to her bag tightly.

Moreso now.",[149,3787,3788],{},"The doors closed, followed by a momentary pause. Then the train lurched forward, bumping her into a girl with a mohawk of tentacles on the seat below her.

She murmured prayers of protection. Nothing happened",[149,3793,222],{},[149,3795,3796],{},"A dozen blocks away from the enclave, wary paranoia gave way to grim clarity. Her premonition had been correct, almost certainly. Two figures had been following her from a distance since she got off the metro.

She couldn’t lead them to the enclave, too risky. She could face them directly, but they had tried to take her life once before and she saw no reason they wouldn’t try again. While she would gladly become a martyr for her faith, she still had the eyes. They had to stay safe. She clutched her amulet and prayed for guidance. The clattering of rats across metal scrap drew her attention to an alleyway. It was filled with junk and debris, likely from the renovation of the adjoining tailor shop. It was perfect. ",[149,3801,3802],{},"She ducked behind a couple laborers carrying a couch, and slid into the alleyway, hopefully unseen.

Don’t think I’d fuck up twice.” ",[149,3825,3826],{},"She was breathing heavily as he drew the pistol, a revolver.

It looks awfully bulky.”",[149,4253,4254],{},"You refused, and insisted you needed everything you had for the long journey ahead. ",[149,4256,4257],{},"The man let out a long sigh, or what seemed like it was meant to be a sigh. The noise was wet and guttural, as if a drowning last breath but in open dry air. “That… will not do.”",[149,4259,4260],{},"You grabbed the reins of your horse, and tapped one of its horns to signal it to start moving. You began to maneuver around the stopped bike. The man said your name. Not your callsign. Not the fake names you give when you stay in town. He said your actual name. You stopped dead and turned around. He was holding the shotgun now, and the veneer of roadside conversation gave way to the reality of the situation. ",[149,4262,4263],{},"You stopped the horse and dismounted. You held your hands up. Scenarios played in your mind. The client had been very clear that losing this package would be as good as dying. The Church had agents everywhere, you wouldn’t be able to run. What of this man? Were there others of his kind? You got the impression he would gun you down without remorse or thought. So, you were dead in that scenario, too. You could give him the box and run, but who was to say he wouldn’t kill you anyway? There was one option, a last resort. ",[149,4265,4266],{},"You agreed to the highwayman’s demands and began to make your way to unfasten the straps holding the box in place. You considered asking how he knew your name, but the curiosity was buried by the material threat.  ",[149,4268,4269],{},"Another flash of lightning overhead. Just what you were waiting for. You reached into your jacket and pulled out a pistol, already loaded. You spun around and fired just as the thunderclap responded. The blast left a crater in the man’s torso, and threw him back to the ground, twitching. His gun fired into the air aimlessly, a futile gesture of defense. ",[149,4271,4272],{},"Blood spattered the dirt and plants, and the body spasmed a couple more times. You averted your gaze and tried to calm your shallow breath. Your horse had panicked from the shot and ran off into the distance. You were outside of your body, watching the scene from some upper vantage point. You acted without your mind, and dragged the body- now surely dead- off to the side of the road. ",[149,4274,4275],{},"It was mandated by faith and law to burn the dead, even if you were the killer. Of course, no court or sheriff would ever hold you to account for what you did. You were no murderer, just a person protecting yourself. Nonetheless, the task of burning the body and releasing the soul of the dead fell to you. You went off to secure your horse and retrieve a cremation capsule from your supplies, but you never came back. ",[149,4277,4278],{},"Maybe it was the looming storm and the beginning of the rain. Maybe you figured another traveler on the main road would take care of it, maybe a traveling priest of death. Maybe you just said fuck it. After all, this man would have gladly mowed you down. Why did he deserve your courtesy? So you left him there to rot.",[149,4280,4281],{},"You left his bike too, though you considered taking it with you. You remembered a delivery girl they called Siren who had stolen a vehicle from a law officer she had successfully overpowered. She had been tracked down and hung using some internal locator on the vehicle. You didn’t know what organization the man you killed belonged to, but you didn’t want to take the chance that they would be similarly prepared. You took your horse and your things and you left.",[149,4283,222],{},[149,4285,4286],{},"You carried on the main road for a while, but a gnawing paranoia overtook you. Who was that man? How did he know your name? Were there others, and would they know where to find you? ",[149,4288,4289],{},"You took the first fork in the road that you saw heading in the same approximate direction. This branch was less well kept, less trodden. It was littered with debris, and you might have lost the path were it not guided by an occasional splash of red paint against the rocks lining the sides.",[149,4291,4292],{},"Come to think of it, you had never seen this road before. You pulled open a map of the south you kept on hand, and found the intersection where the fork would be.  There was nothing. You checked again, and checked the publication date on your map. It was a recent enough copy. No sign of this road. It wasn’t unheard of, for side roads made by locals to not make the official record, but you clung tighter to the reins anyway.",[149,4294,4295],{},"The rain began in earnest, unforgivingly acidic. You stopped, covered the supplies and package with a tarp. You worked on a thick plastic-polymer poncho. It did not cover you entirely, but enough to be safe from the caustic downpour that was to follow.",[149,4297,4298],{},"It did follow, and the skies opened up over the plains. The rain beat an improvised rhythm on the road, yourself, and the hardened mutated hide of your horse. It started in that almost musical percussive way, but soon the torrent drowned out all else. If it kept up, you would need to find shelter.",[149,4300,4301],{},"You carried on for an hour, the toxic sludge that formed on the ground squelched and splashed beneath the reinforced hooves of your steed. You thought about the rains where you grew up. You had grown up on a farm, growing yams for a nearby city. Your whole family was part of the trade, along with several others. You worked closely with your brother managing a harvester. You did this for a great deal of time, but wanderlust had always tugged at your heart. Your life was elsewhere. When your brother’s accident happened- or at least you told yourself it was an accident- you wasted no time putting in your notice and you rode as far away as you could in a single week. ",[149,4303,4304],{},"It had been years since that day. Some part of you missed the relative safety and comfort of that life. The larger part of you, even when traversing through the grime and mud of some forgotten road, would never look back for a second. ",[149,4306,4307],{},"Though, you did look back in a more literal sense. First you noticed the scarlet paint on the rocks was washing off. Was that paint? Over the rain a hum could be heard, louder and louder. A rumble like thunder but too quiet for that. You turned your head and your jaw went slack. In the distance, but clearly enough, you saw the shadowed outline of a figure on a bike riding toward you. ",[149,4309,4310],{},"There was no way it was him, you had certainly sunk enough lead in that man’s body that even redundant vital organ implants wouldn’t have saved him. You destroyed him. Yet that bike was coming right towards you, the rider with those damned luminescent purple goggles. There was no one else on this road, and he was gaining. ",[149,4312,4313],{},"You did not wait to confirm your suspicions, you kicked the side of your horse and broke into a sprint as fast and far down the road as you could. It was no use, the motorcycle was going to overtake you. Your eyes scanned the horizon for terrain to go into. A petrified forest gave the most obvious hope of escape. Your heart pounded with the beating hooves beneath you. You cleared into the forest and maneuvered at top speed around long dead trees.",[149,4315,4316],{},"You were looking back to confirm you were making distance. You didn’t see the stray root in front of you. The horse let out a hideous whine of pain and tumbled into the ground, launching you forward. You rolled head first into a log, and the world went black.",[149,4318,4319],{},"You did not die there, not yet. Though the blinding pain you woke up to made you wish you had. When you came to and the confusion settled, your hands went to your face, and you felt the blood soaking your coverings. You could barely breathe through your broken nose. You panted out of your mouth raggedly and your heart and head pounded in sadistic unison. A terrible noise was coming from not too far away from you. You sloshed out of the soggy ground and sat against the log to get a better view of the scene.",[149,4321,4322],{},"The bike was nowhere to be seen. You had lost him, or whoever that was, but your horse was crying out in pain. Two of its legs were apparently broken. You felt a twinge of sadness for it, then a rush of fear as you knew that your pursuer might hear. You crawled through the mud over to the beast. Only your nose had been broken but the pain in your body was too intense for you to stand on your own. ",[149,4324,4325],{},"You got next to the beast and stayed clear of the poison barbed tail that thrashed wildly around its hindquarters. A knife went uneasily into the creature’s hardened throat, and with some effort on your end you managed to sever its major veins and arteries. The equine blood you were sprayed with merged with your own and your clothes had become a macabre showcase of reds and browns. The horse looked at you with terror in its eyes, it did not understand what had happened to it, or why it had to die now. It kicked and spasmed, and its eyes rolled into its head. It died scared, and you looked away to spare yourself the guilt that bubbled within you. ",[149,4327,4328],{},"When it was quiet, and when the pain you felt became manageable, you made yourself stand. You assessed yourself for wounds. Nothing serious, though you’d need to apply some healing formula to a gash on your nose, and your hip where you snagged a branch. You collected the crate and whatever supplies you could carry. You made camp there that night, carefully. Then you wandered out.",[149,4330,4331],{},"It occurred to you that you weren’t sure which direction you were going. The gnarled brambles and broken trees didn’t give much in the way of landmarks. You thought you identified a unique formation of a fallen tree balanced on the limbs of two others, but there were at least two other instances of that. You kept limping until eventually in the distance you saw buildings. You thanked the gods and pressed forward. ",[149,4333,4334],{},"The structures were unusual, antiquated. Wood siding, hatch roofs, windows. No visible airlocks outside of any of them, though you’d heard that some recent designs had tried to obscure those. You approached, the weight of your gear on your back and the box in your hands compelling you to rest. ",[149,4336,4337],{},"You collapsed near a well, another antiquated design. No machinery you could see. Were they really just pumping water from the ground unfiltered? Maybe they had filters in the houses themselves. ",[149,4339,4340],{},"You craned your neck toward the town, two rows of houses down a main street. Not a single shop, bar, town hall, or anything else you’d expect to see. Isolated settlements weren’t unusual, but to have nothing besides housing was odd. A faint mist crept at the fringes and swallowed the distance. Leftover from the rains perhaps. ",[149,4342,4343],{}," You tried to figure out what kind of place this was, and then you heard the laughter of children approaching. They rounded the well and you saw them. 5 children dressed for St. Dralia’s Day, monsters and popular figures from all across the world. Their leader wore a red cape and a mask that bore the image of one of those titanic lizards from out west, a drak. You blinked and rubbed your eyes. You wondered if it was already St. Dralia’s Day. You wondered further why the kids weren’t wearing any apparent breathing protection in the open air. ",[149,4345,4346],{},"They stared a while longer, and you stared back. The one in the drak mask pointed and spoke, “Bloody rags!” and started to laugh. The other kids began to laugh and sing along, “Bloody rags! Bloody rags!” They circled the well a couple of times, dancing and chanting their song. You got to your feet and began to walk. The mist had intensified but you could see everything within settlement, more or less. ",[149,4348,4349],{},"They pursued you briefly but then broke off to a house. They knocked on the door. An adult in normal clothes opened the door and passed treats out to the assorted receptacles held by the kids. You looked back, and when they were done, the adult just stared at you. Face blank, eyes filled with something you couldn’t identify, but made you walk faster.",[149,4351,4352],{},"The process repeated, groups of kids rang doorbells across the street, treats were passed out, and the occupants of the houses just stared at you. You were not too far from civilization, or at least you didn’t think you were. These people acted like they hadn’t seen an outsider in months. Years maybe. You resolved within yourself to clear this town and get back to the main road. You wanted to ask for directions, but you felt you’d find no answers here. The mist was consuming you now. ",[149,4354,4355],{},"As you approached the edge of town the kids encircled you again. There were more of them now. Their song had developed, albeit tunelessly. “Bloody rags! Bloody rags! Walk a winding road, but there you’ll find your end.” You stood silently as they encircled you. From behind, the adults had gathered without protective gear, forming a stoic wall that blocked you from entering town again. ",[149,4357,4358],{},"The mist overtook visuals, and the singing grew louder. “Bloody rags! Bloody rags! Thought you killed him, but there you’ll find your end!” You clutched your things and tried to find an escape but it had grown so thick you couldn’t even see a few feet in front of you. Your heart pounded and there was this gnawing chill down your spine. You hadn’t been seen when you killed him, when you didn’t burn him. You were sure of it. Did someone tell them? ",[149,4360,4361],{},"The fog cleared, the singing faded into the distance, and you were alone. No sign of the costumed children, no sign of the mob of adults, and the town that had once been restored and full of life had turned dilapidated and ancient. Long abandoned, and its inhabitants long dead or their descendants moved to a safer location. You were alone on a barren stretch of the wasteland, not far from a road. ",[149,4363,4364],{},"You were paralyzed, the events of the last twenty minutes played through your head on repeat. There was no such thing as ghosts, you were sure of that. Though, you were increasingly less sure. You lit one of your cigarettes from the yasre caravan, and let the harmonious melody of buzz and high take you.",[149,4366,4367],{},"When it was burnt down, you carried on for a few hours more in the dark. The Sight you smoked let you move without a lantern, and the world had taken on a faintly light green hue. You spent the whole evening watching the terrain for approaching apparitions or the return of the rider. Finally you slept, and you dreamt of home.",[149,4369,4370],{},"You dreamt of the partner you had left behind when you rode away. You dreamt of your family, and you dreamt of your brother. You were there at your father’s funeral again, and he was out on the veranda. They let you use the manor house to do your mourning, the owner of the farm was not cruel, though he was rarely overly kind. ",[149,4372,4373],{},"You saw your brother crying out there. Some part of you knew it wasn’t just about your father. He carried some unfathomable weight that you could only scratch the surface of. Something you could never truly get your head around, though you tried to in the days that would follow the accident. You thought about going out there, talking to him. You didn’t, and only you really know why. So many of your thoughts are unknown to me. When it comes down to it, would it have saved him? Would it have saved you?",[149,4375,222],{},[149,4377,4378],{},"You carried on for a week without much trouble. You managed to use some discretionary funds to buy a horse from a ranch you passed. You’d still make good time for the commission bonus if you kept up at this speed. The weather had been pleasant enough, and you even got a bit of natural sunlight through breaks in the clouds. ",[149,4380,4381],{},"Some natural plantlife dotted the central south wastelands. You weren’t far from the place from the Ancestral Glades from which much of the forest life of the continent once stemmed. It had been a comfortable break from the tumultuous start of the journey. No one knew, no one had followed you, and you wondered if the second encounter with that rider was even real. People saw things in the wastelands, too much isolation from life was bad for the mind.",[149,4383,4384],{},"Your new horse was white with a red mane and horns that curled like a ram. It lapped up water from a spring that would have been toxic for you, but was safe for its adjusted internal biology. You enjoyed another cigarette and lowered some of your cloth to get some sun on your skin. It burned your pallid flesh but it felt like being reunited with something missing. ",[149,4386,4387],{},"When you heard the engine your heart stopped for a second. Then, not just one engine, but several. A multitude even, cresting the hill from whence you came. You saw trucks, buggies, and bikes pass by until the cloud of ashen dust they kicked up was too thick to see anything clearly. You kept your hand close to your pistol out of well-learned caution, and maybe some paranoia. The convoy continued on without a care for you, but you felt a piercing gaze buried in the crowd. ",[149,4389,4390],{},"When it was clear, you wiped your eyes and you checked your things. The box was still on your horse’s back. That wretched box. The one that had made your life such a nightmare for over a week. You had thought about opening it, but magical seals would reveal your treachery and you knew that. The Church would have its retribution and you would die. Still, some part of you so desperately wanted to know what all this was for. Why not carry it by caravan? Air travel? One courier was nothing. You weren’t even a real courier by professional standards, more of a delivery person. ",[149,4392,4393],{},"You shook your head of the thoughts and looked back to the road, now covered in tire tracks. There was something else in the road, too. Something large, in two pieces. You hesitantly walked over. Then you gasped and fell to your back. You scrambled away and peered over. It was a body, your body, but it couldn’t be. The clothes, the height, the build, it was you. Except the head, which had been severed and replaced with a ceramic helmet. On its face a neon painted smile, sloppily scrawled like a kid would draw. ",[149,4395,4396],{},"Away from it a few feet was the real head. You walked closely toward it, checking the road and surrounding terrain for traps and watchers. You picked it up with the caution of someone handling a bomb. The face you saw was not yours, but it was close. The hair color, the eye color, all correct. The nose was slightly off, but the message was clear to you nonetheless. You dropped the head and screamed into your hands, trying to muffle it. You collapsed onto the ground and sobbed. Why this had to happen to you, you didn’t know. You cursed the job, and considered just dropping the box. You knew this wasn’t an option, not if you wanted to survive. ",[149,4398,4399],{},"Your only options were to move forward and deliver the crate, or die to them or to this unseen tormentor. You steeled yourself, and you searched the body. You found two things on it, a note, and a small glowing orange capsule. The note was written in wild scrawl, by someone with not much control over their hand. “You should have burned me.” and a crude drawing of a heart alongside a barely legible skull. ",[149,4401,4402],{},"How could he have survived? You were so sure you had done the job. You cursed yourself for not burning him when you should have. It was a sin, the 12th sin in Church canon. You were not an avid practitioner of the faith but reverence for the dead went beyond religion. What if it had been you? You rationalized it, said it was a matter of time. You had been so sure a traveling burner would do the job for you. We like to explain our sins to ourselves in ways that make us out to be more noble than we ever really were. You were no different in this respect.",[149,4404,4405],{},"You took the capsule in hand and collected the two scattered pieces of the body, your body. You burned it, and it did not take long. The stench of flame searing flesh slithered its way into your rebreather’s vents and stayed there long after the job was done. In mere minutes, the body turned to ash and this poor fool, killed as a pawn in some other game, was put to rest. ",[149,4407,4408],{},"You got on your horse and rode as fast as you could away from there.",[149,4410,222],{},[149,4412,4413],{},"You rode for almost a day straight before you found some caves you could convince yourself they were safe enough to take rest in. Another storm was coming and you thanked the gods for the shelter. You were another day from the nearest town. ",[149,4415,4416],{},"You saw the lights in the cave and that gave you some pause. You carefully peered inside, and you were fairly sure it wasn’t the man you were looking for. Instead, you came inside and found me. I had been waiting for you, but I didn’t tell you this. You brought your horse and things in and I greeted you pleasantly. The fire was roaring and I was sitting cross legged in its warmth. ",[149,4418,4419],{},"You were taken aback. Perhaps you didn’t know what to make of me. After all, I don’t wear the protective gear you did. I do not need to do these things to survive out here. I marveled at you. You looked exactly how you did in your mind’s eye, though maybe a little more ragged, and a little shorter.",[149,4421,4422],{},"I offered you a seat, and when you secured your horse you joined me. You had grown so wary by the time we met. You kept your hand near your gun at all times. Maybe you were always like this. I knew so many things about you, but I knew so much less than I wanted to. Even now, you’re a mystery I’ll never get to solve. This is okay, I do not need answers. I appreciated your company all the same. ",[149,4424,4425],{},"You regarded me carefully. Perhaps you recognized me but you couldn’t figure out where from. It clicked when we introduced ourselves. You said your name, which had such a delightful ring to it. I said mine, and you knew me as “Ridlek of Morwood.” You did not believe this was a real name, as St. Ridlek is a figure of legend for you. For me, it is just life. The only life I know. ",[149,4427,4428],{},"We talked. You asked me what I was doing out there, and I told you the truth. I was on pilgrimage to the Glades, and then I would continue on to the Veil that bordered the south. I asked you why you were out there, and you told me a lie. Something about going to see your family out in Sidersberg. I let you keep your secrets, we both quietly knew the truth.",[149,4430,4431],{},"I offered you some wine, and you said no at first. I took a swig and let its bitter, metallic taste fill me. I offered again, and this gesture of deference was enough to convince you to say yes. You took out your last two cigarettes and offered me one. We had a delightful evening drunk and high at the fire. You never asked what was in the wine that tasted so strange, and I never told you. It might have mattered, had things gone differently. They did not go differently, so it did not matter. ",[149,4433,4434],{},"When we were thoroughly intoxicated, I asked more about you. We talked about a lot of things. Life on the ash farm, life as a delivery person, the differences between delivery men and couriers in Astaelian parlance. You asked about me and I told you about life in Morwood, what it’s been like seeing the sights. You assumed I was lying. Maybe I was. Time, space, reality… All things I experienced differently from you. We would never have had enough time for me to explain the truths I knew and still know. It did not matter, this was not my story. It was yours.",[149,4436,4437],{},"We talked about your family, about your mother, father, and brother. You told me a bit, though not everything. You were glad to have a chance to speak about it. When the evening had grown long you admitted that you felt as though you were being hunted. That you had been turned into prey for some kind of predator that had decided to toy with you before making the kill. You did not tell me about shooting him, or about failing to burn him. You just said that you were worried. Worried that if you didn’t figure out something you would be consumed.",[149,4439,4440],{},"I told you, plainly, that you had to finish the job.",[149,4442,4443],{},"When you woke up the fire had smoldered to embers, and I was gone. I left behind the flask of wine and another gift for you. So you knew I was real, and so you knew how to best handle your phantom. ",[149,4445,222],{},[149,4447,4448],{},"Another week passed and you traveled safely. More signs that you were being followed cropped up. Dead animals, notes, splatters of blood. You had grown desensitized to it. It invoked less a sense of terror, and more a grim inevitability. You would find him out there. My words carried with you, and you would finish the job.",[149,4450,4451],{},"You picked a place and began your work. At the farm, hordes of wild boar would occasionally try to make a run on your crops. Fighting them with conventional weapons was impractical. So you would set traps and feast on wild pork. The same principle as now. You would hunt the hunter, or you would die trying.",[149,4453,4454],{},"My gift you placed in pieces against the exterior wall of a rocky tunnel, carved into a cliff face to keep the road going. A handheld device connected to them all, though you set several cables of thin twine to set it off should that fail. You stood at the edge of the overpass, and made certain that the natural lay of the land made it impossible to circumvent without passing through this point. Your enemy did not know you were prepared. ",[149,4456,4457],{},"You waited, and kept waiting. So long passed that you began to wonder if he would even come at all. You knew he would, but he always seemed aware of your movements. Maybe he saw this trap coming?",[149,4459,4460],{},"When you were about to pack up and give up, you heard the familiar engine. The bike roared down the road right at you. You stood and held your hands up, a feint of surrender. By the time the man could see your smiling face, it was too late. You pressed the button and threw yourself to the ground as the blast shook everything. ",[149,4462,4463],{},"You blacked out briefly and your ears were ringing, but when you came to you saw the tunnel collapsed. You cheered. Though you realized now you had no means of burning the body. You had to burn the body, so you started trying to pull scorched stones off the pile. Maybe the body was destroyed in the blast? Would you be so lucky? ",[149,4465,4466],{},"You went back to your horse to grab a tool to dig through the rubble. You were met with another blast and a with a searing pain in your back and stomach. You gawked at the hole in your gut. You tried in vain, and through hideous pain, to put your intestines back in your body. You collapsed to the ground, the blow to your spine left you unable to walk. You spat up blood that filled your mask. You ripped it off and looked around in desperation for the source of your wound. At the edge of the tunnel there was a man, or a creature, half of one. Ichor pooled together into the body of a humanoid, you would not have identified it as the rider were it not for the hat and clothes had had been absorbed into its form.",[149,4468,4469],{},"It held a shotgun that smoked from the blast. It was not human, not any of the other species either. You’d never seen anything like it. Beige twisted flesh sculpted itself into new life from some kind of liquid slime state. It held the gun with distended, unnatural arms that flared off into tentacles in every direction. Some kind of mutant? A lab subject? You never got to find out. ",[149,4471,4472],{},"You crawled toward the crate. Your blood stained the ground beneath you. Your head was light and your heartbeat irregular. You would not survive. You had to know what was in the crate. You had to know what this all was for. You pulled it down and unsealed it. The reassembled man- or rather creature- stood over you. It waited for you to open the box, and it trained the gun on you for a final shot.",[149,4474,4475],{},"Inside the box was the same sterile white. Secured in its center was some kind of book, face bound in ancient leather and marked in a language you couldn’t begin to comprehend. Your head was light and your strength failed you. The rider kicked you over, away from the case. ",[149,4477,4478],{},"When you come face to face with a monster, it is natural to expect to see cruelty, malice, bloodlust. These things make sense to us. They are impulses that even someone who isn’t a monster could feel, given the appropriate context. In this way, we expect monsters to be like us. We make them more human than we have any right to, because we are more comfortable with the things we know. ",[149,4480,4481],{},"When you looked into the rider’s gnarled, twisted face. You saw nothing. No hint of desire or want, no hatred for you. It was as empty as the void, and in your final moments that is what scared you the most. When it raised its shotgun and fired a blast that pulverized your skull, it did so without care.

I prayed for myself, too. I beseeched the gods to get me out into the open air again - real air, away from the city and all the bullshit.

This field of energy shielding the city from the rolling clouds of ash above, turned black by the night.

In the center of it all, the grand spire that shot all the way into orbit. The smell of chemical exhaust hit my nose. It wasn’t my favorite, but at least it felt more honest. ",[149,4778,4779],{},"I caught an aircab and considered where to go to find my contact.

It was almost 11 now, and I hoped the person I was looking for would still be there. Some girls with matching glowing hair offered me a bump of Frost. I declined respectfully, though they didn’t know what to make of me saying it would make me sick. They started talking to me about dosage and safety, which I sat through patiently until it was our turn at the bouncer. ",[149,4792,4793],{},"Haelga was at the door tonight. Good, Haelga knew me. They were big, even for a primas-ika. I always wondered if they had gotten muscular-skeletal work done, but it never really felt like my business to ask.

How ya doin’ girl?”",[149,4795,4796],{},"The girls behind me looked a little envious that I was recognized. I relished it, “Haelga! It’s been a while.

Not a bad one at least.” I really felt no shame in my condition, though I appreciated their care.",[149,4810,4811],{},"“Right.” They looked at the line of increasingly irate women and nonbinary people behind me. They handed me a headset. “You’re good to go in. Catch me on my break!”",[149,4813,4814],{},"“You know I will!” I probably wouldn’t, but no need to spoil the moment. ",[149,4816,4817],{},"The airlock closed behind me, with enough people to cycle. Under the environmental shield, it was more of a formality, available for emergencies. Some people made use of the complimentary lockers inside to stow some belongings and change into their clubwear. We could all feel the thrumming bass of the music within. Someone pressed the cycle button. It ran its process, and upon completion, the interior door popped open.",[149,4819,4820],{},"I stepped out and was hit with a wall of sounds that moved everything around me. A heavy, pulsing bassline that drowned out the melodies above them. I worked on my headset, meant to help talk over the noise. To my left, the bar, to my right, a sea of people on the dance floor. I stopped by Kal at the bar and played nice. Ordered the Korvuni Blue, which tasted like fermented citrus, and hit like a truck. Haelga made a good call.",[149,4822,4823],{},"I paid for the whole bottle, took it, and traversed the floor from the outskirts, along the tables on the far side.

I did a 180-degree turn, and there she was. ",[149,4828,4829],{},"She was sitting at a table, beckoning me to come over. Small for a human, though for all I know, she had done that on purpose. Yellow hair that formed into trills, matched with bright red spots on her cheeks that gave her the aesthetic of a long extinct cockatiel. She wore a sweatshirt that hid her frame, which was contrasted with black shorts. Her boots were up on the seat. Birdie. ",[149,4831,4832],{},"I approached the table as she shooed two others away.

The digital clock on her nightstand said 6:54 a.m., but the lack of windows made it hard to verify. I lifted my head as best I could without disturbing her. My eyes adjusted to the faint power lights of electronics scattered across her spacious bedroom. The brightest of them was the dim yellow glow of the powered-off liquid immersion tank in the corner. My eyes rested on my bag and prosthetics, placed on a chair in the corner. ",[149,4899,4900],{},"I looked down at her, nestled into my shoulder. Still fast asleep. She was clutching my good hand, or I would have run it through her hair. She really was beautiful. I stared at her body for a moment, physically gifted too. The night before was fun. Lovely, even. Some part of me still couldn’t shake the feeling that I was going to let this woman down.",[149,4902,4903],{},"The clock struck 7:00 and a shrill alarm sounded. She stirred, crawled over me, and turned it off before returning to my side. “Morning, Alice.” she eventually muttered into my skin. ",[149,4905,4906],{},"“Morning, Birdie.” Her hair trilled when I used her name. ",[149,4908,4909],{},"She was quiet for a bit.

She tried to help me get dressed, and I gently warned her off. I made my way over to my bag and my limbs. I had daily maintenance to do, but that could wait until I was back at my place. ",[149,4920,4921],{},"“So where did we leave off on the Kanra’Las villa?” I said while fitting on my arm. ",[149,4923,4924],{},"She was wearing a bra and her shorts from last night. She retrieved an infoslate from a library near the tank and was pressing the scroll button to look through it. She danced over to me triumphantly and delivered in a singsong tone, “This should be allll you need.”",[149,4926,4927],{},"We stepped out of the door from her bedroom/office, and into the living space. A long metal table was covered in papers and the empty bottle of Korvuni Blue we had brought back with us. The room was lined with other furniture. At the far end was a well-stocked kitchen and pantry. Birdie explained last night how this was once an interrogation chamber. She made sure it had fallen off official records.",[149,4929,4930],{},"I looked through the tablet.

A slight difference noticed by almost no one but the most time conscious of passengers. Those few were shut up with complimentary drinks.

Yeah, I’ve got a body count. Who doesn’t, if they’ve lived a little? I knew the whole fucking time, I probably even heard about the girl you mentioned. Didn’t remember because honestly?

They all  knew what a Courier was. “In truth, I do a bit of information work. Even some hits when I need to. Unfortunately, my client said I couldn’t kill you.

My friends can hear.” Dorian tugged at his jumpsuit and revealed a black metal square with a couple of buttons and receiver for audio input. Less bulky than any wire Elise had seen before.

They fell over the coffee table and onto the floor. The two struggled. She clawed at his face, drawing blood from his cheeks. Dorian’s training kicked in and he punched her where the heart would be if she had one. It knocked the wind out of her and he sprung to his feet. The cops rushed in and tackled her.",[149,5429,5430],{},"“For what it’s worth, I do come from money. But I’ve made my own fortune ending careers.” Another smile, “Like yours.

He admired himself a little longer. Then he turned toward the room, his room now. It was spacious and quiet. Perfect really. He poured himself a club soda and relaxed on a couch, legs up.

He admired the heavenly light as it was consumed by the cloudline it hovered above. ",[149,5444,5445],{},"It was a while longer before the airship’s 3am landing. Outside he could hear the festivities of the imminent holiday. Maybe he’d go out, meet some interesting people. Live a little.

They flooded the cabin, stained red with the injected drug, turning the pale light bloody. As one, all twelve of the sporeball players shed their lethargy and rose from their seats.

One of them pushed off the back of Nata’s seat for leverage, so forceful it tore the cushion. They closed the distance in an eyeblink and hurled themselves at the chemi.",[149,5948,5949],{},"Fungal sinew met lab-grown flesh like a wave colliding with the shore.

I looked at a hand-drawn map posted on the dashboard, and measured where we were. 6 hours to go. ",[149,6113,6114],{},"I took us off the main road. Fools took the highway. Any scavver worth her merits had a competent internal sense of the stretch of wasteland they operated closest to. The terrain outside shifted from the outskirts of the city, with its ash farms and refineries, to that liminal space where you’d see the occasional building or compound, to the open wastelands. I gazed out my reinforced window at sulfur marshes, jagged rocky terrain, and petrified forests. Life. Real life. I stared dreamily at a couple of boars fighting over a patch of shrubbery’s gnarled berries. Authentic.",[149,6116,6117],{},"There was a lot of time left before we got there. I glanced at Temperance. “So are you still ordained?”",[149,6119,6120],{},"Temperance looked down at their robes, “Yeah.”",[149,6122,6123],{},"“Any particular aspect?”",[149,6125,6126],{},"“Champion of The Reaper.”",[149,6128,6129],{},"I whistled. “A burner huh?”",[149,6131,6132],{},"Temperance’s brow furrowed. “That’s not what we call ourselves, but my primary duty was to release the souls of the dead.”",[149,6134,6135],{},"“By burning them.”",[149,6137,6138],{},"“Occasionally I have to get more creative, but fair.”",[149,6140,6141],{},"“Makes sense though.”",[149,6143,6144],{},"“What does?”",[149,6146,6147],{},"“I feel like burners tend to have the least scruples about shady stuff. If I see a priest in crime, 9/10 it’s a champion of Our Lady Death.” I made a reverent gesture with my good hand. ",[149,6149,6150],{},"Temperance looked at my arms. “So why the simple metal?” they pointed to my prosthetic right arm. ",[149,6152,6153],{},"I appreciated people like Temperance, who were forward enough to just ask. It was better than the people who stared and averted their gazes when I looked back. “Ever heard of Nuralis Syndrome?”",[149,6155,6156],{},"“Happens to humans, right? Means chems and augments are like poison to you?”",[149,6158,6159],{},"“Mostly humans, 1/100,000 of us. Genetic. More often chems just don’t work or make me a little sick.”",[149,6161,6162],{},"“Do mechanicals not work?”",[149,6164,6165],{},"“With some really risky surgeries they could, a lot of the prep process is more alchemical than people realize.”",[149,6167,6168],{},"“So why the merc life?”",[149,6170,6171],{},"“What do you mean?”",[149,6173,6174],{},"“Well, if any of us three are blown apart, shot, or whatever, we can get patched up with a healing potion or some time in a clinic.” They wiggled their fingers. “Only two of these are originals. Seems like you have more to lose.”",[149,6176,6177],{},"I thought for a few moments, “My parents wanted me to play it safe. I was a freshman in college when the war broke out. They moved overseas to get away from it. I signed up for the Royalists as fast as I could.”",[149,6179,6180],{},"Temperance gave me a look. It hadn’t ended well for the soldiers of the old monarchy.",[149,6182,6183],{},"I continued unphased, “I guess I’ll tell you what I told my folks when I signed up. That I don’t think a life lived in fear is a life worth living. Doctors gave me 20 years to live when I was born. I’m 28 now. I can take care of myself. Stuff like this helps me afford that.”",[149,6185,6186],{},"Temperance gave a single “Ha!” and then took a more understanding tone, “I see your point. Guess that’s all we can do.”",[149,6188,6189],{},"I followed the road as best I could in the dim light afforded by the cloud cover. Sure enough, signs warning of private property ahead began to line the roadway. I made a hard right and watched for drones and spotter towers. Corporate territory was well defended and authorized to use force. A privilege they exercised gleefully. I did my best to keep near the border signs but parked us behind a stone formation that hid the full frame of our vehicle. ",[149,6191,6192],{},"We disembarked, unloaded the cargo, and I set the car’s safety mechanism. I bent down to the ground and scooped up a handful of ashy dirt. The others looked at me like I was insane when I took off my rebreather and took three deep breaths of the air. It was a bad air quality day, and it smelled like it. It was heavenly. ",[149,6194,6195],{},"I touched the rock and held my pendant. I prayed quietly while they waited, though I heard Temperance join in their own prayer. I righted my posture and turned to the crew. The four of us were finally ready to make the run. ",[149,6197,6198],{},"These people were entrusting their lives to me. I wasn’t going to let them down. I blew my nose clear of ash and put the rebreather back on. “Alright. Some of you may have walked off-road in the wastelands before. Nonetheless, I’m going to act like it's yours’ first time.”",[149,6200,6201],{},"I started pacing “I am going to lay down three rules that you will obey if you want to stay alive.” I counted with exaggerated finger motions, “ 1. When I tell you to do something, you do it. There will be no discussion, no debate. Obey me. 2. If you see something coming at you that isn’t one of the four people here, you shoot. Corporate soldiers, Imperials, marauders, wildlife, the fucking Helping Hands Brigade, open fire. 3. If we come across a ruin, do not touch *anything*. No matter what you think it’s worth. If it looks like a good haul, tell me. I’ll look at it, and I’ll even let you keep it. That’s how nice I am. IF at any point there is somehow a conflict between Rules 1, 2, and 3, prioritize Rule 1.”",[149,6203,6204],{},"I spun around to face them, “Any questions?”",[149,6206,6207],{},"Nobody said anything. Dorian started walking.",[149,6209,6210],{},"I shook my head and we made our way into the corpland border. ",[149,6212,222],{},[149,6214,6215],{},"I pressed my back against a half-destroyed granite wall and held up my hand. The voices outside were still talking. Too far and too metallic to make out details. It sounded like bursts of radio static in conversation with each other. Three? Yeah, three voices. I stuck my head out very slightly. Nice armor, armed well, and a mounted turret on their truck. Corporate for sure, couldn’t make out which one. No way we were taking them. I tapped the worn wall with my metal fist. This wasn’t going to hold up against turret fire. ",[149,6217,6218],{},"So the next question, what do we do? We could have left out the back and hoped they didn’t see us. Too much open land, and not enough concealing terrain. Taking them out already wasn’t an option. That left wait, but that depended heavily on what they were doing out here. If they were just passing by, why stop here? If they were a patrol, they were probably going to check this structure. So, how thoroughly?",[149,6220,6221],{},"I looked at the rest of the tower structure above us. Early Parathan Imperial as best as I could figure. The solid granite building would give way to blends of basalt and decorative marble later in their reign. There were two more floors, partially exposed by a collapse in the structure. I wouldn’t trust the top floor but the middle floor didn’t look too bad. The stairs went in the collapse, so we’d have to get creative. I made a mental path of things we’d have to climb to get up there. Quietly, if the gods were kind…",[149,6223,6224],{},"One of the metal voices was getting closer. My choice was made for me. ",[149,6226,6227],{},"I motioned the others to follow and made my way from a pile of ancient, hardened sacks of grain. Next, I grabbed a rusted wall sconce and used it to swing up to the protruding lip of a column. Then I leveraged myself into an alcove in the wall, and from there I could reach the second floor. I grabbed it, solid enough on this side. Praise the gods. I wriggled my way up and started helping the others following the same path. Arina was almost too short to make the last jump, Temperance and I had to help her up. ",[149,6229,6230],{},"We got up just as the patrolman reached the threshold. A gust of wind blasted us from our vantage point. I tried to quiet my breathing, which was amplified through the mask. ",[149,6232,6233],{},"We heard him talking, clearly now, “Yeah I heard it too. Sounded like something running around in here. Praise.” There was a quiet that followed, I heard each heavy step of his boots. He got closer to the edge of our floor. Arina was sticking too close, I pulled her back by her legs. ",[149,6235,6236],{},"“Don’t see anything. Same empty tower. Orders? Praise.” ",[149,6238,6239],{},"There was some second end of the conversation we couldn’t hear. ",[149,6241,6242],{},"“Yeah, probably vermin. I’m headed back. Praise be.” The boots began stepping away, then past the threshold. Temperance started to stand up, and I whacked them on the back. I made a down motion with my hands. We weren’t clear yet. I waited until the truck’s combustion engine came to life, and drove away. ",[149,6244,6245],{},"I peeked my head out of the window on our floor. “Clear.” Sighs of relief all around. Everyone started standing up. “Careful, I don’t know how much I trust this level.” I tapped the ground with my foot and a stone brick shifted. “Actually, I don’t trust it.” ",[149,6247,6248],{},"Dorian stepped off first, with no regard for the drop. He landed like a cat. Fall augmentation? Arina and Temperance went down with a little more caution. I checked around for any unscavenged swag. No use. This place had been picked dry centuries ago. I went down next. It was getting dark outside. I considered making camp here. We were about half a day away from our destination, and we’d have to use lanterns to go much further right now. Too visible.",[149,6250,6251],{},"Scavvers had rules against spending too much time in Parathan ruins. I wasn’t particularly superstitious. I didn’t think the demise of the Parathan Empire was some curse by the gods or anything. At least no more a curse than that inflicted on the rest of the mortals of Vian. There were more… Wait. Something in Dorian’s hand. Something small, metal, pipe-shaped. It didn’t come in with us. ",[149,6253,6254],{},"I rushed over, “What do you have?” He looked up and down at the object in his hand. He tried to put it away. I asked again, nearly screaming. “What do you have?”",[149,6256,6257],{},"I forcefully grabbed his hand and pried it open. I shrieked when I saw it. A brass rod engraved with runes that were faintly illuminated blue. I grabbed it with my metal hand and ran outside. Dorian roared after me. “WHAT THE FUCK?” ",[149,6259,6260],{},"The rod began to emanate a high-pitched whine. “RULE 3!” I shouted back. ",[149,6262,6263],{},"I threw the rod as far as I could away from the tower. It detonated in a huge red flash.",[149,6265,6266],{},"I felt firm hands pull me back and spin me around. Dorian was screaming at me. “YOU FUCKING IDIOT! I FOUND IT! IT WAS ENCHANTED!” He punched me, aiming for my nose and instead jamming my mask deep into my face. I stumbled, confirmed nothing was broken, then I pushed him back. We struggled, I hadn’t realized how much I wanted a chance to knock sense into this prissy idiot. I got him in a headlock for a second, he drove an elbow into my gut. Temperance pulled him back. I went in for a punch but Arina charged into my abdomen, trying with all her might to hold me there.",[149,6268,6269],{},"The anger fizzled, and I looked back at Dorian. I clutched my knees and tried to breathe, “Do you know how to read Serish runes?” ",[149,6271,6272],{},"Dorian was trying to catch his breath too, “I took a couple courses in university… one course.”",[149,6274,6275],{},"“Parathan hand grenade.” ",[149,6277,6278],{},"Dorian started walking towards it. ",[149,6280,6281],{},"I held up my hand. “No telling how many uses they charged that thing with. You’re lucky I caught it before we all got blown to the gates of Atharas!” ",[149,6283,6284],{},"He didn’t say anything, just stormed inside. ",[149,6286,6287],{},"I called to everyone, “We’re not staying here!

Victory. “Glad to be of service, ma’am. I promise I’ll be faster than a crawler through mud!” He turned off his mic.",[149,6464,222],{},[149,6466,6467],{},"I looked at the others. “Crawler in mud. That’s our signal!” We gathered up our things. Rebreathers on, though more for anonymity than breathing safety. I began to climb up the ladder, then Arina, then Temperance.",[149,6469,6470],{},"We reached the hatch. I pushed it open and slid out onto the pavement. When we were all up we closed the hatch. The whole place was surprisingly bright. Sterile white light panels had been installed at the base of the wall, and more hung from the metal framework of the glass roof. We were behind a shed. I peeked around the side. A lush green meditation garden, marked with a spiral pattern of stones toward the center. Birdie’s interior map was accurate. I would have to ask her how she sourced it. Temperance peeked out from behind me. “Rather pretty,” they observed. ",[149,6472,6473],{},"I ducked back behind the shed. “Artificial. Did you see anyone?”",[149,6475,6476],{},"“2 guards, a custodian, and it looks like a busser from their kitchen.”",[149,6478,6479],{},"“Guardhouse should be to our right… follow me.”",[149,6481,6482],{},"We ducked left into the shrubs that bordered the garden. Not too far from it was a pool cleaned by a tread-mobile drone. It paid us no mind. Arina rereleased Dotty and had it fly into an exposed vent. When a guard wandered too close to us, she had it start blaring noises through its loudspeakers. They ran towards the vent, and we slipped past toward another shed. Close to the villa itself now.",[149,6484,6485],{},"One sentry between us and the front door. We could go around back but that would be close to where Dorian was distracting the security chief. The sentry stood in place. Fuck. I felt Temperance’s long talons on my shoulder. They gave me that kind of diagonal head bob that’s meant to say ‘I got this.’ ",[149,6487,222],{},[149,6489,6490],{},"Temperance stood back. Spellwork wasn’t their forte, or they would have pursued becoming a full-fledged mage. They took a long breath and closed their eyes. They focused on chanting. Drawing on this kind of power took a mix of concentration and the right set of invocations.",[149,6492,6493],{},"Something beyond themself began to push at their mind. The Barrier that all spellcasters must pass. They focused harder and imagined themselves pushing a pin through that Barrier. Power began to seep out, and they grabbed it.",[149,6495,6496],{},"Magic manifested into the Threads of reality. Either modifying them or creating new ones. They focused on the Threads and felt their natural resonance flow around them. The energy flowed into their hands, which began to pulse and glow. Soon, their whole body was enveloped in the shimmering field. ",[149,6498,6499],{},"Neither Vulture nor Arina could focus on them. Cloaking spells didn’t turn the caster truly invisible but rather bent the Threads around them so that looking at them directly became impossible. ",[149,6501,6502],{},"“Can you all see me?” They made a couple of rude gestures and stuck out their tongue. Vulture and Arina shook their heads and averted their gaze out of discomfort. “Good, then grab onto my shoulders!”",[149,6504,6505],{},"The other two complied, though with a bit of extra effort. Soon the shimmering field spread around us as well. Vulture tried to look at Temperance. No luck, like butter sliding on a hot pan. The group turned and started walking. Making a wide U shape around the sentry with their back turned to them. At one point he started turning his head in their direction, but it was like he couldn’t completely. He didn’t seem to mind.",[149,6507,6508],{},"They made it to the grand natural birchwood double doors. Alice grabbed a doorknob and stared at the metalwork. It looked like Restoration Age craftsmanship. Rich bastard. Vulture tried it. Unlocked. Dumb bastard. It opened inward. She looked inside for any immediate sentries. She made a motion to Temperance and Arina, and let go of the priest’s arm.",[149,6510,6511],{},"It was an open floorplan, very modern. Contrasted by centuries-old decor. Paintings of nobles, and a couple of landscapes. Even some Parathan era swag, like a grand blue vase that had been apparently reassembled with bronze.  Temperance looked at Vulture, and saw in her eyes the hungry look of a scavver who was staring at one of the biggest hauls of her life. Then a shake of the head and her focus was back on the job. Temperance appreciated Vulture more than other would-be crew leaders. She had good priorities. This was too clean to risk with extra loot. That was the safe play. Though, maybe if the team got some extra time…",[149,6513,222],{},[149,6515,6516],{},"I made my way toward the far end of the room, where the sole occupant was dusting some shelves. The custodian had his back to me. It was as if the gods had ordained this run.  I kept low, to avoid being seen through the wide windows. Temperance held back and Arina was messing with the tablet. I closed the distance quickly. I opened my arms to grab him. ",[149,6518,6519],{},"He started turning around. ",[149,6521,6522],{},"Fuck. Impulse took over, I swung my metal arm in a punch. It connected with his skull and he tumbled back into the wall. He slumped, and blood started to trickle down the side of his head. ",[149,6524,6525],{},"The other two ran up. “Holy shit,” Temperance said, mirroring my thoughts. I held out my hand to Arina, “The mirror you have. Now.” She passed it. Temperance held up his head. I held it under his nose. Still breathing. That was going to need some treatment though. At least-",[149,6527,6528],{},"A rifle’s hammer clicked. ",[149,6530,6531],{},"I looked over my shoulder. Arina was holding a gun to a woman in a nightgown. Our intel said his wife was supposed to be in Sidersberg. His wife who was a human… This is an elek… younger too… Ah. I stepped forward and tried to reassure her. She shriveled at the sight of blood on my hands. “Please don’t scream.” An empty appeal to a foregone conclusion. She let out a piercing wail. ",[149,6533,6534],{},"The gun fired and the woman went to the ground in a seizure. A fake bullet stuck to her and sent an electrical burst through her. She’d live but it’d hurt for a while. I nodded to Arina who had a look in her eyes that indicated that was her first time doing that. I tapped her on the shoulder and led us up the stairs. I heard shouts, followed by alarms. The bad outcome. I loaded a stun bolt.  ",[149,6536,6537],{},"Up the stairs. One door guard, armored. He raised a gun. I raised my wrist and ducked. I fired just a second before him. The bolt struck him in the chest and the rifle’s shot went wide. He started convulsing on the ground, but would probably be fine. Probably. I checked behind me. The others had gone to ground. I smirked. We might be able to take this. I tapped my communicator. “D, how are you holding up out there? Praise.” ",[149,6539,6540],{},"No answer.",[149,6542,6543],{},"With worry, “D?” ",[149,6545,6546],{},"Static.",[149,6548,6549],{},"I looked to the others, who were looking down the stairwell. Arina called out “I count at least 3 more. They sound heavy.” I started eyeing the hallway we were in. I tried the door to Kanra’Las’ room. Locked, figures. I tried the others. No luck. I eyed the available furniture for cover. A few tables. Antique wood, but nothing that’d take a bullet. ",[149,6551,6552],{},"“T, got a smoke grenade?” ",[149,6554,6555],{},"They looked at me like I said something dumb. Then reached into their bag and grabbed a canister. Activated it, and threw it into the center of the room. A plume of red-grey smoke began to fill the hallway. Perfect. These two weren’t soldiers but I figured we had a fighting chance. I stepped back and loaded another bolt. Lethal this time. Pistol in my other hand. Let’s go. ",[149,6557,6558],{},"I heard a click behind me and the opening of the door behind me. I spun around. The deafening bang of a gunshot. I felt a deep heat in my abdomen. Blood soaked the clothes around my gut. An elek standing with a pistol in his shaky hands. Blonde hair, balding. Kanra’Las. The pain caught up to me. I crumpled to the ground. ",[149,6560,6561],{},"Temperance screamed and rushed towards me. I couldn’t think or see straight. It was like I was viewing the events through a few layers of removal. There was an Alice on the ground, bleeding out, but I was watching her from way high up. From the sky. Maybe from the void. I tried to remember the advice I had been given for this back in the service. My mind was too cloudy. From my aerial view, I saw guards swarming our position. Then I saw nothing.",[149,6563,222],{},[149,6565,6566],{},"Ice-cold water splashed my face. For a moment it was like I was drowning. I thrashed weakly, like a caught fish. “He’s alive.” some distant voice said Then I felt someone grab my jaw and pull my mouth open. More water went down my gullet.  Some instinct took over in me and I drank it greedily. There was so much pain in my abdomen. I had never understood why people wanted water when they were dying, but it made more sense now. ",[149,6568,6569],{},"My vision returned to me. The two armed men who had been dousing me with a bucket of water left the cell. The cell. I looked around, my vision blurry. Pain too serious to think. The others were there. Or at least so I thought. Temperance ran up to me. Arina stood over. I saw Dorian in the corner of the large dark holding cell, arms folded. “Where… were you?” I spat out blood and groaned in pain. ",[149,6571,6572],{},"“I was hiding. Key, *was.* Until someone started blowing up my radio and gave me away.”",[149,6574,6575],{},"Some twinge of regret, muted by the agony. “S-so-sor-” I was shaking. ",[149,6577,6578],{},"Temperance shot their head back “This isn’t the time. She’s hurt.” They looked at me. “Healing potions don’t work on you, right? They tried to apply Formula Y and it just wouldn’t take.”",[149,6580,6581],{},"I nodded. I thought about dying. About my soul. I wondered how soon I’d get to see the beautiful land they said the gods took us to. I looked at the priest, “You’ll burn me…”",[149,6583,6584],{},"Temperance shook their head. “No, I won’t. I don’t burn the living. You’re not dead yet girl, come on. Stay with me.”",[149,6586,6587],{},"“Can’t you just magic it or something? You’re a priest right?” Dorian was sitting and sulking now. ",[149,6589,6590],{},"Arina agreed, “Yeah you could! You showed us that cool cloak technique out there!”",[149,6592,6593],{},"Temperance frowned. “Healing magic is difficult even for a full-fledged mage. The Lady of Magick doesn’t like us messing with the forms of others.” They paused, “I can try. Arina, keep her awake and alive. Dorian, just brood, I guess.”",[149,6595,6596],{},"The young elek ran up. “What do I do? What do I say?” She looked terrified. I imagined what I looked like from her point of view, pallid and dying.",[149,6598,6599],{},"“Just ask her questions.” Temperance was chanting something to themself and wringing their hands together.",[149,6601,6602],{},"“Okay… Hey Vulture. It’s Arina! You’re going to be okay. Just focus on my voice. Look in my eyes. My mom says she likes my eyes… Sorry, I’m nervous.” ",[149,6604,6605],{},"“It’s okay... They’re… a good shade of gold.” I offered. I was having trouble staying conscious. Maybe I could just sleep. ",[149,6607,6608],{},"Temperance smacked my face firmly a couple of times. “Hey, no sleeping. Arina, keep her awake at all costs.”",[149,6610,6611],{},"Arina jumped and ran up and repeated the face-smacking motion, though hesitantly. She looked like she was about to cry. “Hey, please stay awake. Uhm- tell me your name.”",[149,6613,6614],{},"“Alice…”",[149,6616,6617],{},"“Okay, great, what’s your last name?”",[149,6619,6620],{},"“Alice… Mercier-Durante.”",[149,6622,6623],{},"There was a pause. I knew I had said something I wasn’t meant to. It didn’t matter. I gnashed my teeth as Temperance put their hands in my wound. After a second they pulled back and tossed a piece of metal to the side. “The bullet is out.” They poured some of the water bucket on it. Then put their hands back on my wound. A strange warmth filled my side. ",[149,6625,6626],{},"“Okay… Alice Mercier-Durante. Where are you from?”",[149,6628,6629],{},"“My family is from Saliana… I grew up in New Bekton… s-since I was f-f-four.” I was shivering. ",[149,6631,6632],{},"“That’s a long way to go. Why’d your family move out here?”",[149,6634,6635],{},"“Doctors. For me. Organic.”",[149,6637,6638],{},"“That makes sense. Your parents must love you a lot.”",[149,6640,6641],{},"“They do. I was… I was their only…” I screamed, something sharp in my side, almost like getting shot again. ",[149,6643,6644],{},"Temperance made eye contact with me. Yasres had such intense yellow and red eyes. “We’re almost there Alice. Just hold on.”",[149,6646,6647],{},"Arina kept going, “You… were in the military right? Violetcoats. So was my dad! What was your battalion?”",[149,6649,6650],{},"“11th.”",[149,6652,6653],{},"“The Hand of Providence right? I never served, too young, but I heard a lot about you all!”",[149,6655,6656],{},"“Y-eah.” the pain was disappearing. Not like shock. Like the wound itself was leaving me. ",[149,6658,6659],{},"“Almost there.” Temperance was massaging the wound now. ",[149,6661,6662],{},"Arina looked up and tried to think of something to say. “Okay, Alice Mercier-Durante, tell me about some music you like.”",[149,6664,6665],{},"“Guitars… Folk instruments. Big fan of Natasha Irinde before…” Her turn towards Imperial sympathy was well known.",[149,6667,6668],{},"“Yeah, I was too.” Arina consoled. ",[149,6670,6671],{},"The pain was still present, but lessened and dull. Like being poked with the blunt edge of a pen. I looked down, and it had been replaced with a bulging mound of flesh. Temperance looked up at me. “It should be safe. It’ll probably leave a scar. I am not a professional healer.”",[149,6673,6674],{},"I smiled weakly, “Thanks.”",[149,6676,6677],{},"They stood up and went to take a seat on another bench, panting to catch their breath. My bench, I realized, was covered in blood. ",[149,6679,6680],{},"Arina did the same. Then she started sobbing, which triggered a look of disgust from Dorian. ",[149,6682,6683],{},"We stayed there in that scene for a while. I rested my head against the wall.  Dorian glared at Arina’s sobbing, and eventually, Temperance went over to console them. I realized their nose was bleeding. “You good, T?”",[149,6685,6686],{},"They nodded, putting an arm around our youngest. “Don’t worry about me, V. Get some rest. You lost a lot of blood.”",[149,6688,6689],{},"Arina stopped crying, going to that sniffling phase that often followed. Dorian eventually said something to her. “Is this your first job?”",[149,6691,6692],{},"The elek raised her head. “No, I’ve done a couple… No one’s ever gotten hurt before. We just took some stuff. Maybe we fired guns over people. Ykno.”",[149,6694,6695],{},"He scoffed, “They put me with amateurs.”",[149,6697,6698],{},"I turned my head, “Hey, leave her alone. She’s been doing fine.”",[149,6700,6701],{},"He looked back at me, “It wasn’t just her I meant.”",[149,6703,6704],{},"I forced myself to sit up and face him. “Why did you even take this job? It’s not like you need the money.”",[149,6706,6171],{},[149,6708,6709],{},"“Come on, your whole high maintenance, low awareness, fancy vibe. That’s someone who never has to worry where their next meal is coming from.”",[149,6711,6712],{},"“Not what this is about, but okay. Sure. I come from money. We even have a big stake in STARCAST. That’s why I’m here. What about you Ms. Mercier-Durante? I had you pegged for some poor first-generation immigrant, but I know your family. Made a huge fortune on the terraforming projects out east. You’re telling me that’s not money?”",[149,6714,6715],{},"I regretted my mindless confession. “I don’t take a dime from them.”",[149,6717,6718],{},"“And I don’t take a dime from mine! But the fact that you could, any time things got too bad. That’s what matters. You talk about being real, about wanting the real, but you’re just as fake as me. As the rest of us.”",[149,6720,6721],{},"I lowered my gaze, at a loss for words. I leaned back against the wall of our cell. ",[149,6723,6724],{},"After a few minutes, “I’m a Varan.” Arina volunteered, wiping her eyes.",[149,6726,6727],{},"“Good for you, sweetie.” Dorian’s tone was hollow. ",[149,6729,6730],{},"“Am I the only one here who isn’t secretly rich?” Temperance half shouted, half laughed. ",[149,6732,6733],{},"I looked at Arina, “Varan like…”",[149,6735,6736],{},"“Like Varanskeep yeah. That was my dad.” A doomed city, blamed on the failings of its rulers. A story known to all in recent memory. ",[149,6738,6739],{},"“I’ve met survivors but… why didn’t your family leave the country? Can’t imagine you have many friends here.”",[149,6741,6742],{},"“I don’t tell people my last name. I go by Arina Greencroft in my classes.” ",[149,6744,6745],{},"Classes. “How old are you?”",[149,6747,6748],{},"“21. I’m a senior at NBU… Or I was. I don’t think they’ll let me graduate if we get booked for this.”",[149,6750,6751],{},"My attention turned to the area around the cell door. A long mercrete hallway in either direction. No sign of any guards. They probably would’ve just let me die. There was a vent but nothing we could reach. “Did they say what they were going to do with us?”",[149,6753,6754],{},"Temperance had recovered, “Something about reaching out to STARCAST security to come pick us up. No one else with jurisdiction, I reckon.”",[149,6756,6757],{},"“Okay, so that can’t happen. How do we get out of here?”",[149,6759,6760],{},"“If I had my glove it’d be easy.” Dorian then pointed a finger at the priest. “I mean can’t you just magic the bars open or something? I’ve seen spell types bend metal before.”",[149,6762,6763],{},"Temperance shook their head, “Healing Vulture took a lot of energy out of me. I don’t think I’m casting again for a while.” ",[149,6765,6766],{},"Dorian shot daggers at me with his eyes, “So we’re stuck here because you had to save her.”",[149,6768,6769],{},"“What if it was you?” Arina snapped.",[149,6771,6772],{},"Dorian sneered, “It wouldn’t have been.”",[149,6774,6775],{},"I pulled myself to a stand and wobbled a bit. My muscles were weak and I was lightheaded. “It doesn’t matter. D’s right, I botched the job. So it’s on me to get us out of here. I don’t know how, but there’s got to be a way. Maybe we call the guards, and say I’m dying.. They don’t know I’m healed. Or-”  I became acutely aware that none of them were paying attention to me. Something was behind me.",[149,6777,6778],{},"I turned around and faced a purple drone with white spots floating at eye level.  Dotty. It adjusted its resograph lens to look at me. “Huh.”",[149,6780,6781],{},"We all looked at Arina, who held up her small hands. “Not me, they took my slate.”",[149,6783,6784],{},"I turned around again. The drone had protruded an exterior metal arm and was messing with the lock. “I think I know who it is.” I made a silent, solemn vow to fuck that woman senseless when I got back to the city. ",[149,6786,6787],{},"The lock relented and the door opened slightly. I thanked the drone and Arina and Temperance did too. Dotty, and presumably Birdie, gave an affirmative bounce. I peeked my head out into the hallway. One led to another cell. These cells were decently sized. Why did this place have the capacity to hold like 20 people? I shook the thought from my mind. The other way must lead out. I beckoned for the others to follow.",[149,6789,6790],{},"We stayed low and quiet. There was a resograph above us but it seemed powered off. Another gift from Birdie? The hallway turned. This building wasn’t big, we had to be nearing an office. I popped my head around the corner. Yeah, an office. Two guards in there. They were armed and armored, and we weren’t either. Though we had numbers. I looked at Dotty, not a combat model. I tried to think. What would we do in the service?",[149,6792,6793],{},"Shock and awe. ",[149,6795,6796],{},"I explained my plan through a series of complex gestures and whispers. They communicated back something along the lines of ‘you’re crazy.’ I retorted with a motion that meant ‘trust me.’ Then I reached into my leg and checked the hidden compartment. The knife was still there. Merciful gods.",[149,6798,6799],{},"I started to move forward. Once I was sure they didn’t notice us I stood up. Then I steadily worked up to a sprint, fighting past my body’s protests.",[149,6801,6802],{},"I rushed in and picked the one at the desk, a Primas-ika, judging by the slots for horns on the armor and their large size. I started stabbing in every weakness in their armor I could find. Several strikes to the neck. Their arm flailed for their pistol, which I wrenched out of their hand.",[149,6804,6805],{},"I didn’t think. I just stood back, disengaged the safety, and fired twice in the chest. Blood spattered on the chair, the wall, and the floor, and merged with some of my own on my clothes. Temperance, Arina, and Dorian were beating the shit out of the other one. They turned her in her swivel chair toward me. I gave her one shot to the head.",[149,6807,6808],{},"With both guards in the station dead, we collected ourselves. I tried to clear my mind of what just happened, and my eyes scanned the office. 6 guards in the facility, 6 desks. I looked at the primas-ika, with a special badge on their chest. Security chief. I figured the dead lady was the second in command. Good… good. I saw a row of lockers and footlockers. Several bags of items were placed on the ground. Our gear. ",[149,6810,6811],{},"We rushed over and reclaimed our things. Dotty was inert, whatever remote control was exerted over it having been released. How Birdie pulled this off at such a range was beyond me. Arina grabbed her slate and regained control of it. Temperance began the rites of the dead for the slain security officers. The stench of burning flesh filled the room and set off the smoke alarms. I opened a locker left open by someone careless. The contents within gave me an idea. “Hey, do any of you know how to pick locks?”",[149,6813,6814],{},"Dorian nodded and Arina raised a hand. Temperance stood up from the burned bodies, “What are you thinking V?”",[149,6816,6817],{},"I stroked my chin. “No way they don’t know we’re coming. We’ve been caught once, and *that.*” I motioned to the piles of ash from the dead. “We tried doing this the subtle way.”",[149,6819,6820],{},"Temperance looked at the lockers, opened by the other two.

I needed more blood than I had. I had to get to the end. I had to see this job through. They sat me in a swivel chair and put me in front. We had taken a break to steel ourselves.

When she was out of the others’ line of sight, she did another bump of her drug of choice today. They called it The Red.

Instant, aggressive mania.",[149,6914,6915],{},"The door where the noise was coming from was off in a hallway. Too small to be a bedroom. Too big to be a closet. An office maybe? Didn’t matter.

They were frantically trying to grab something. ",[149,6917,6918],{},"She popped out, rifle up. For an elek, time didn’t move the same. Sometimes if they focused enough, it could slow down a bit. So when she raised her gun and saw the janitor from earlier charging her, she wasn’t terribly surprised. Must have gotten a healing treatment. She saw the ornate sword in his hand, glanced up at the display case on the wall above the desk, and she put two and two together. Not enough to stop him from tackling her, but enough of an edge that she knew how she’d play this. ",[149,6920,6921],{},"They wrestled for what felt like ages to her but must have only been ten seconds. Her rifle went off. He knocked it out of her hands. She scratched at his neck, as high as she could reach. He ripped her helmet off. Normally, a human man would easily overpower her. The Red coursing through her veins gave her the strength to kick off. He swung the blade at her, and she felt a sharp pain across her mouth. Her focus faltered and time returned to normal.",[149,6923,6924],{},"She went all in center mass, headbutting his unarmored gut. He doubled over and she ripped the sword from his hands.

He thought she was weak. Everyone thought she was weak! They all talked to her like she was a little kid. She was fucking sick of it. How fucking dare he disrespect her? She was a fucking Varan. The Red did the thinking for her. She taught him who he was dealing with, and started stabbing. She brought the blade down again, and again, and again. Long after he stopped moving.",[149,6932,6933],{},"She stood up and held the dripping sword in her shaking hand. Dotty stared at her, unmoved. She felt her lips, she was bleeding. Not bad enough to care right now. She grabbed her rifle, put back on her helmet, and left the sword by the corpse. She took one more bump for good measure, stepped over the corpse, and closed the door behind her.",[149,6935,222],{},[149,6937,6938],{},"Arina rejoined us and told us the problem had been handled. She had this frenetic energy about her. I figured it was fine, whatever gets the job done. We made it to the stairs, I wobbled out of my chair and began our march up. I held my shield up and everyone did the same. No way they weren’t waiting for us up top. ",[149,6940,6941],{},"We were right. Bullets started flying into our shield wall as soon as we were in sight. Three of them, behind deployable cover, in sealed armor. We settled in our position and crouched. Temperance threw a glass sphere over our heads. It landed in the middle of their defenses in a whoosh of flame. One of them caught fire and started howling. Shields down, we opened fire. Two of them went down easily. Bullets across their torsos. The third got a shot off and I heard Dorian exclaim. Arina retaliated with a shot to their neck. They went down suffocating. ",[149,6943,6944],{},"6 guards down. That should be them all. I turned my whole body to face the enchanter, “You okay D?”",[149,6946,6947],{},"He was clutching his arm. “Grazed my arm. I’m fine.” He clenched his teeth. “Fuck! Stings though.” ",[149,6949,6950],{},"Temperance set another charge on the door to Kanra’Las’ room. It blew open and we charged inside.

If he did, he didn’t go that way.”",[149,6958,6959],{},"I started walking around. I took my helmet off. “Intel says there’s a panic pod in the room. Start searching the floor and walls.”",[149,6961,6962],{},"We started doing a thorough search of the place. Trying for buttons, levers, and switches. Anything that would reveal a pod an elek could hide in when he got scared. Finally, a decorative wall panel came loose. I ripped at it until it gave way. Then all four of us pulled the pod out. I looked for an opening mechanism. It was tied to a keypad. Fuck. ",[149,6964,6965],{},"“Did anybody see a code? This wasn’t in the briefing.”",[149,6967,6968],{},"We kept searching the room, except for Dorian. He got out of his riot gear and worked on his gauntlet. “Allow me.”",[149,6970,6971],{},"He took out a set of arcane tools, and began to tinker with the keypad. “I haven’t had a chance to actually use this all trip.

Dorian snapped his fingers and it repeated in a loop. Object memory, I think it was called.",[149,6982,6983],{},"I punched in the code. The pod was unsealed and opened. Kanra’Las was inside cowering, protecting his face. “Whatever it is you want, I can pay you!”",[149,6985,6986],{},"“We’re already getting paid.”",[149,6988,6989],{},"“I can pay you more!

Arina grabbed the rigged memory cartridge and inserted it into a metal port at the base of his brainstem. ",[149,7012,7013],{},"While we waited, I pondered exit routes. No real opposition left. Any support they could have called in was still hours away. We could just walk out the front if we really wanted.

Normally, it was music this early, but he had taken a break for a special news bulletin. Something about a group of raiders hitting an estate in corplands and absolutely massacring the inhabitants.

He went on to talk about how the government was characterizing the assailants as ‘chem-addled.’ Swell further alleged that this was a false flag operation to further discredit drug use, which the Empire had been working towards recently. He kept going, and I swapped to a folk station.",[149,7028,7029],{},"I remembered what day it was and hopped to my feet. I washed my hair and brushed my teeth.
