It smelled not unlike burning moss.",[149,286,287],{},"He took a long drag, held his breath, and looked up. The sky was smothered in dark clouds, occasionally broken by pale green rays of moonlight. He looked back down to the town around him. The alley he stood in was lined by composite structures, none of which rose above three stories. He stood on concrete pavement painted by dust and ash. There were countless settlements like this across the wastelands, but the relative centrality and size of this one had earned it the name Crossroads.",[149,289,290],{},"He hacked out the exhale and struggled to control himself. The thin air and his weakened lungs only hastened the urgency. He held the metal mask in his other hand to his face, and took a few cleansing inhales. When his breathing had calmed, he brushed a bit of dust out of his grey hair, and let himself enjoy the quiet moment. The cigarette's mild stimulant washed over him, a warm buzzing feeling.",[149,292,293],{},"He checked his watch. Their contact was late. He frowned at the bad sign, but there wasn't much to be done about it now. His boss would know what to do from here. He sighed, stamped his cigarette out, and went to head inside.",[149,295,296],{},"The bar's entrance was sealed by an exterior airlock that protruded from its prefabricated construction. In this way, it was like every other building in Crossroads. A vintage cast iron sign hung from the top, illuminated by the buzzing white street lamps. \"The Ebonsteel Pony,\" which had the visage of the eponymous pony, was fashioned from the dark, enchanted steel.",[149,298,299],{},"When the exterior hatch opened with a hiss, Torinn and a few others shuffled inside. The hatch closed behind them, and he worked off his mask and took some deeper, unrestricted breaths. The interior was a small metal room with another doorway on the other side. It was lined with lockers and a few benches, where many of the patrons deposited rebreathers and protective gear. Two green glowstrips lit the room faintly from above.",[149,301,302],{},"Someone hit the button to cycle the airlock, and the background electrical hum climbed pitch to a whine. The smell of sterilizing agents assaulted the nose and left a lingering chemical taste on the back of the tongue. The lights turned red momentarily, and the whine grew louder; a couple of occupants covered their ears. Within a minute, the process was complete, and the interior door popped open into a bustling bar.",[149,304,305],{},"The persistent mechanical noise of the airlock was replaced by music and raised conversation. A woman with horns like a ram was singing and playing a guitar, accompanied by backing music from a soundboard. It was upbeat, folksy, and reminded him of the sort of music his kids would like. Many of the patrons ignored the music, but a decent crowd had gathered around her. Her melody carried to the rest over an internal sound system. The bar goers were a mix of locals and travelers of all different shapes and sizes.",[149,307,308],{},"No one paid Torinn any mind as he made his way through the central room. He bumped past several others, apologizing each time, and always checking his pockets after. He'd grown to distrust crowds. The noisy squall drowned half-remembered instructions of where he was supposed to go.",[149,310,311],{},"The music stopped, and over the speakers came the singer's voice, \"Thank you, thank you. I've been Natasha Irinde! You've been great, but I've gotta get out of here before curfew.\" Drunken boos and calls for an encore. \"Okayyy fine! You all are incorrigible!\" She tuned the instrument. \"I've got one more for you all. It's a favorite for true Astaelians! About a cowardly nobleman who abandoned his city. A man by the name of Lord Varan.\"",[149,313,314],{},"Torinn's heart sank deep in the recesses of his chest. He knew what song she meant. The crowd was ecstatic. She grinned and pumped her arms to hype them up, \"Oh you all know it? Great! Sing along with me! It's called The Lord of Nothing. \" Half the bar joined her.

The walls muffled the sound, but not well enough. He remembered his calming techniques. Not much help. Fascist fucking dogs all over this godless town. He needed to get to where he was going. Seeing a set of three doors, he made a judgement based on the placement of the alley, and tried his luck with the rightmost one.",[149,353,354],{},"He was right. The door swung open revealing the diminutive frame and irisless golden eyes of his employer, an elek named Gallin'Vir. He wore a light grey business suit a few steps too formal for the setting, complemented with a vintage bowler hat that covered strawberry blonde hair.",[149,356,357],{},"The small man's long, rounded ears perked up, and he adjusted a pair of antiquated spectacles. He didn't waste time on formalities. \"You're a quarter-hour late.\" The tempo of his speech was rapid, but Torinn had learned to keep up.",[149,359,360],{},"Torinn stepped into the private room as quickly as he could and half slammed the door. \"I ran a little long. Was checking the exits on the place and got caught up-\" He stopped himself. \"It doesn't matter. Place is as secure as we can ask for. We can leave out of the back just fine...\" He gestured to the miniature airlock on the far wall of the room. \"Where are they?\"",[149,362,363],{},"\"Also late.\" Gallin'Vir's rapid cadence was burdened with a layer of annoyance. \"You smell like smoke. Are you high?\"",[149,365,366],{},"Torinn raised an eyebrow, \"When's the last time you saw me get high? Just polyspice.\" He looked around the room; like the rest of the building, it was constructed mostly of metal, though they hadn't bothered to wallpaper it. Most of the space was taken up by a large round table. A single suspended light bulb without a shade cast sickly white light over the walls, adding to the discomfort. Apparently they were displacing a weekly poker game.",[149,368,369],{},"\"Still, you shouldn't be smoking with your-\" Gallin'Vir stopped halfway through.. \"Never mind. Are we ready?\"",[149,371,372],{},"\"Up to you.\" Habit dictated Torinn check his weapon. He unholstered it and did a quick once over. It was a revolver with two firing chambers, one stacked on top of the other, a Jerris Model X. Firing both barrels kicked like a mule and required wrist augmentation for safety, but it was a cherished gift from his wife. He confirmed it was loaded and put it back.",[149,374,375],{},"The two of them made conversation while they waited. Plans for their return back east. Torinn's experience in this region. Gallin'Vir's work. 10 turned to 11, and 11 turned to midnight with still no sign of the people they were waiting to meet. At some point, Gallin'Vir started pacing.

No trouble would follow.",[149,526,527],{},"Settled in their private car, Torinn gnashed his teeth as the last scattershot pellet was removed from his side. It was a flesh wound, but no amount of getting shot was ever really acceptable. Gallin'Vir opened up his bag, revealing vials, bottles, and composite flasks that each glowed and glittered different colors. Torinn knew these were tools of a trade, but they seemed wondrous all the same. The small doctor took out a cloth, some cleaning solution, and a vial filled with a glittering red liquid marked \"YF\".",[149,529,530],{},"Torinn was shirtless and glanced out the interior window to make sure no one could see. He was in exceptional shape for his age, with extra broad shoulders that flattered his above-average height. Regardless, he had a classical sense of modesty.

He worked fast, wiping down and cleaning the wound expertly.",[149,532,533],{},"Gallin'Vir uncorked the glass vial. \"This will sting,\" he cautioned, though Torinn knew how this went. A couple of drops fell onto his wound, and the alchemist massaged them into the torn skin. Torinn bit his forearm to keep from crying out. Instead, he let out a low, pained grunt as the flesh began to stitch itself back together. Within half a minute, the wound was closed. All that remained was a bulging bit of irritated flesh. \"Looks to be healing well. Don't pick at it, and it will be gone within the hour.\"",[149,535,536],{},"Torinn nodded and thanked his healer. Yender's Formula was a marvel, but uncomfortable. One's flesh and muscle repairing itself at that speed blended the sensation of burning and electrical tingling. At the very least, Gallin'Vir was adept at his craft. Torinn had received much worse treatment. He still had a bit of trouble moving his left shoulder after a botched application in the war.",[149,538,539],{},"The alchemist made eye contact with him.

He grabbed his brown button-up from the floor, noting the damage. He'd see about getting it patched up.

He folded it, stuffed it in the bag, and put on a simple black tee he kept for emergencies.",[149,550,551],{},"He sat back down and looked out the window. A destroyed landscape sped by. The wasteland was a vast stretch of ash and jagged rock formations that carried on into the Alura Desert out west. Further out from that was the foot of the Kavan mountain range. If one looked closely in the moonlight, they could see it dotted with mutated plant life, ruins of civilizations before, and small settlements. Then the nagging memory manifested in the words and song of the bar musician. Somewhere out there, beyond view, was a hole in the world. What remained of Varanskeep, his home.",[149,553,554],{},"He kept staring, and the mechanical rhythm of the train's motion lulled him into a sort of trance. This carried on for what could have been hours, broken when Gallin'Vir began talking to himself.",[149,556,557],{},"The elek had opened one of the packages: the canister. It was metal, with a prominent dent in the side. He reached into the container and pulled out a round, snub tube made of brass and glass. At one end of its structure, Torinn noticed a small switch.

He shifted his question. \"Is it alright?\"",[149,562,563],{},"Gallin'Vir stopped mumbling, and his head darted up. After a second to process, he nodded, \"Yes, yes. The container absorbed the impact. No fuel, as expected. No reason to think this would be volatile. \" He went back to looking down and took out a small black rectangle of metal and glass. He thumbed a button on the side and began tapping on its surface. The dataslate was Gallin'Vir's preferred notebook.",[149,565,566],{},"Torinn let out a long sigh and grabbed a flask filled with brandy from his bag.

He knew how lucky he was, compared to many others, especially among the pre-Empire nobility. Gallin'Vir was doing important work, even if few other people realized it. Torinn's family had heavily instilled the virtues of history. Even past superstition, he saw the value. The Parathan had nearly conquered the world. So much was accomplished. Their advances in the science of alchemy had built the modern world, without doubt.",[149,574,575],{},"Of course, all empires fall, and the Parathan fell spectacularly. \"The Judgement\" came. First, a cataclysmic earthquake that shook the whole of Vian, killing millions. Next, almost the whole world was buried in ash and rock upon a volcanic eruption from the supervolcano Draiskaln, followed by every other active eruption site on the planet. The mortals of Vian survived, just barely, but the old Empire was mortally wounded. It would collapse within the year. So much was lost.",[149,577,578],{},"Gallin'Vir's profession was finding the things that were lost when they fell.",[149,580,581],{},"Torinn used this for assurance. They were doing good.

Good time, all things considered. The platform crowded with tired people as they shambled out of the cozy train into the bitter air of the night.

He assured Torinn they'd meet in time for their departure. The bodyguard lamented the separation, but knew when his charge made a decision, it was final.",[149,608,609],{},"He sprung to alert when shouts came from the adjacent platform. A bulky, 8-foot tall reptilian known as a Primas-ika, and their child had been stopped by metallic yelling from station officers. These officers, military police, wore sealed cobalt blue armor. One of the soldiers demanded to see IDs. Both parent and child pleaded for mercy as guns were waved in their faces. One of the cops pulled on the parent's long braids. The parent cried out and went to pull open their bag, perhaps a little too quickly. They were struck in the face with the butt of a rifle. Another soldier fired into the air and held the gun to the kid's head. The instincts of the other travelers had taken over. The platform cleared in less than a minute.",[149,611,612],{},"All three officers declared their authority in the name of the Empire and screamed for both of the Primas-ikas to get on the ground.

No amount of obedience would have spared them.",[149,614,615],{},"If they were lucky, the parent would walk away with some injuries and a fine. The child would escape with memories of the cruelty that exists in the hearts of some adults. Torinn's fists tightened as he pondered the darker alternatives. Then came the gnawing rage. People were just going to let this happen! How easily he could draw his pistol and take care of things. Surely their Empire wouldn't miss a few enforcers.

Natural?\"",[149,625,626],{},"The young man, one of the relay technicians if Torinn gathered correctly, received the cigarette graciously and took a small puff.

The same could be said of most arcane and alchemical technologies. Still, that didn't ease his mind when the large, tubular locomotive came roaring into the station.

Outside of the main cars were reinforced, rounded alloy plates that each had \"GT FLASHTRACK\" painted on its hull.",[149,735,736],{},"He looked over to Gallin'Vir, who was staring at the porters loading their luggage. He frowned and stood on the tips of his toes. The flashtrack's setup didn't allow for personal luggage to be carried with the passengers. Torinn set his hand on the smaller man's shoulder. Neither of them said anything. He wasn't the best comfort. Gallin'Vir thanked him with a slight smile anyway.",[149,738,739],{},"Torinn watched as the previous passengers of the train filed out, waiting for their turn to board with similar anticipation to a man awaiting execution. Soon enough, they made their way in. The inside of their car was dark. No windows, per safety regulation. The glowing red thermal light strips on either curve of the rounded rectangular ceiling provided adequate lighting and nothing more. In the stead of individual seats were metal benches with two harnesses and headrests attached to each side.",[149,741,742],{},"Torinn worked on his harness. It made a tight 'X' across his torso. He felt like a trapped animal. He didn't want to be here.

It was all deafening.",[149,744,745],{},"He closed his eyes and sighed. When he got anxious he pictured his wife, Salee. Her blonde hair with tasteful streaks of grey, swept into a ponytail. Her kind green eyes. How she'd hold his hand a little tighter than he would expect of hands so fine. How she'd say, \"It's all okay. This will pass.\" He lingered there in the moment, then he felt a sharp prick in his right hand, followed by a rushing coolness into his veins.",[149,747,748],{},"Torinn yelped and opened his eyes in surprise, he looked down to see the syringe that Gallin'Vir had jammed into his hand. He met the elek's orb-like eyes, \"Just a mild sedative,\" he said, with a casualness that suggested drugging someone was the most normal thing in the world. Torinn didn't know whether to be furious or grateful. The sedative kicked in and decided for him. His muscles relaxed and he placed his head back on the rest. Nothing left to do but enjoy the ride.",[149,750,751],{},"A distant call came from outside, and the automatic doors shut. Within five minutes the train was in motion. Departure was slow and normal at first, despite what the accommodations within would suggest. That changed twenty minutes into the trip. A klaxxon buzzed twice, and the flashtrack lurched, throwing the occupants back in their seats. A humming started, slow and almost impossible to perceive above the background noise of the train's motion. Then it turned to a buzzing, and the air took on a blueish hue. A faint stench like hair burning in the distance assaulted his nose..",[149,753,754],{},"From behind he heard a porter walking.

The same place where the Council of The Gods had gathered their first followers, ten souls to spread their influence across the world. The Prophets, who would build their namesake hall on that peak.

There was a desk, a bed, a kitchen, a bathroom, and windows that revealed the purples and oranges of the last glow of day. In the center of it all, in a couch setup in a shallow pit in the floor, was an elek. The person, presumably TheoâVir, was in very fine lounge clothes.",[149,2715,2716],{},"The occupant spoke first.

Please, do be careful.â Arina wrenched it out of his hand and looked away, her face red.",[149,2733,2734],{},"Temperance had stepped forward, âOne more thing.â They held out an ornate vial of dark green liquid. âGallinâVirâs regards.â In their other hand, a pistol that Arina hadnât seen earlier.",[149,2736,1453],{},[149,2738,2739],{},"âT?â Arina was more surprised than concerned. TheoâVir was awful, surely, but no one had told her this was a hit job.",[149,2741,2742],{},"The Yasre gave her a look as if to say ânot now.â What they further tried to convey, unsuccessfully, was âDonât you see how clearly this bastard deserves it?â",[149,2744,2745],{},"âSoâ¦ itâs like that.â Inerlesians had a sense of honor about these sorts of things. TheoâVir had two choices, he was dead either way.",[149,2747,2748],{},"The Director of Parathan Research walked towards his bed, slipped off his shoes, and drank the vial. âTheyâre not going to let her control the family fault. Inerlesian civilization is ruled by real men. Not pretenders, not frauds.â He lay down and closed his eyes. âWretched disgrace,â were his last words. He choked on his liquifying insides and died.",[149,2750,1468],{},[149,2752,2753],{},"A sea of shouts and orders echoed towards them. Unlikely they were getting out the way they came, and here wouldnât be safe much longer. Arina looked to her comrade, âT?â",[149,2755,2756],{},"âA minute, please. Ritual must be observedâ¦â They paused their sentence to finish the prayer and add an amen. When they concluded, they produced a glowing orange capsule. The commotion was getting closer. Another prayer, and the capsule was broken open on TheoâVirâs body. The body burst into flames that wondrously didnât spread to the bed. The smell of a burnt corpse was strong even through their masks. In another life, well before Arina had known them, Temperance had been a priest of Death. Burners, they were often called. They still held their old practices in reverence.",[149,2758,2759],{},"Ritual observed and the spirit of the dead released, Temperance made quick strides to the windowed wall on bouncing avian legs. They started placing sticky explosives on the wall near the window. âYou got something, T?â Arina asked, trying to purge the last few minutes from her mind. She didnât even know there were still people who felt like *that.* She signed up to grab a book. Sheâd killed before, but no one had said this was a hit job.",[149,2761,2762],{},"Temperance took cover behind the couches, she did too. The explosives went off, and the howling open air tore through the space, papers from the desk swirled in the wind and blew outside. Another explosion shook the floor, Something had been destabilized. The Psried stood up and produced a spray canister from their bag.",[149,2764,2765],{},"They screamed over the wind that ripped papers and loose objects out of the tower. âSo, current and only plan. You know how they used to fire people out of artillery back in your allâs war?â",[149,2767,2768],{},"Arina nodded. âMy dad was in one of those units!â",[149,2770,2771],{},"âWell, this was meant to replace that. Didnât get much field testing, though. But it *should* work.â They glanced at the kilometers-long drop down, and the environmental shield they would have to clear. âOkay, it might work. Probably. Maybe.â",[149,2773,2774],{},"Arina looked at the unfathomable distance below. How far up were they? âThatâs fucking crazy.â",[149,2776,2777],{},"Another explosion shook the floor, this one more intense than any before. They had to brace themselves. Voices outside the door. Temperance looked toward the entrance, to the improvised exit, and back to her. âGot any better moves?â",[149,2779,2780],{},"Arina didnât. She shook her head. âFine. Sounds rad anyway.â She tried to convince herself that things that scared her were cool. She held out her hand to spray, but first they handed her a pill. âYou wonât be able to breathe. This will help.â",[149,2782,2783],{},"She took the pill with apprehension, but she trusted her partner, her comrade. What other assurances did they have, if not each other? They embraced once more, and then Temperance began to apply the spray. It covered her person and began hardening like a stone. She couldnât see it, but it expanded around her into a rough egg-shaped pod. The Yasre was right, she couldnât breathe, but she didnât need to. It was freaky.

An icon of St. Kathen, the Pathfinder. My mother gave this to me when I turned 13 âso I would always find my way back to herâ. I smiled and tucked it into my pocket; it was always with me.Â ",[149,2855,2856],{},"I wrapped the cloth underlay of my prayer setup around the rest of the components. I carefully lifted the bundle and made my way down the roof hatch.",[149,2858,2859],{},"My apartment was cozy, in the way that cozy doesnât always mean comfortable. A former storage container converted into a tight 1 bedroom, the same as the rest of Pier 17. I kicked down the folded stairs and made a careful descent. The hatchâs seal hissed behind me, a little strained. Iâd need to replace the tubing soon. I did the cost calculation in my head and felt a knot form in my stomach. Money was never easy, but medical expenses had left things tighter than usual.Â ",[149,2861,2862],{},"I set the prayer bundle down in its spot and flipped on the radio, tuned to Dr. Swellâs talk show. Swell, an energetic DJ on a pirate frequency, had a bent for conspiracy theories. He was rambling on about a discrepancy in caravan records. He claimed this proved that the Empire of Astael was making traders disappear. I didnât know anything about it, but it wouldnât be surprising if true. I continued, half listening as I got dressed for the day. I had work later.",[149,2864,2865],{},"For someone with my condition, jobs are hard to come by. I couldnât receive the chemical surgeries required to get specialized work, and even normal jobs were harder without the ability to metabolize potions. When I lost my arm in the war, I couldnât get a replacement; normal employment became the object of distant dreams.",[149,2867,2868],{},"Those days, my tasks came from men like Oren Maklivi, who fancied himself a talent broker for those who couldnât turn to conventional means. If you needed something recovered from the wastelands, and you couldnât turn to legitimate means, you hired a contractor from the underworld Community. If the Community wouldnât touch the job, you called someone like Oren to find help. At the end of this chain of channels and backchannels were freelance scavengers like me. Scavvers, theyâd call us. People braveâ or desperate enough to go into the wastelands alone. Â ",[149,2870,2871],{},"Yesterday, I got word via a messenger drone that Oren had work for me. I was expected to leave the city by the end of the day. I slipped on a simple shirt and pants, earthy colors. I had tucked the joint behind my ear while I worked on my jacket. Genuine leather was expensive, but my parents enjoyed modest wealth. They had it dyed a patriotic purple and had a gold gryphon sewn into the right shoulder, standard colors for Astaelâs now-defunct Royal Army. They were so proud the day I enlisted. I didnât like how the shoulders rested on my frameâ much too masculineâ but I had missed my parents since they moved. So I kept finding excuses to wear it; I just balanced the look with some makeup.",[149,2873,2874],{},"Swell had swapped to music. Something from a singing construct that went by Chytri Ganoda. Not my style, too synthetic and poppy. The tech was impressive, though. Those units were getting smarter by the day, it seemed. I finished carefully putting on a bit of eyeliner and switched off the radio.Â ",[149,2876,2877],{},"In a fluid, well-rehearsed motion, I grabbed my prosthetic off the table and worked it onto the stump where my right arm was. Some careful mechanical rigging had allowed me limited motion with the digits. There were slots for modular inserts on the wrist for tools and the like, but I didnât have anything installed today.Â ",[149,2879,2880],{},"Next, I opened up my work bag and checked the contents. I had some gloves, climbing gear, a first aid kit, a space heater, and wind-shielded tenting in case I had to spend the night outside of the cityâs border. Then of course the complex mix of metal bars, screws, and wiring that made up my crossbow. The weaponâs metal frame was collapsed and bundled into a metal rectangle with some bolts covered in electrical wiring. Finally, a rebreather; a small metal mask that wrapped around the face. A must-have for open-air exposure - even in the city only the foolhardy walked without one. My kit was simple as most scavvers went, but traveling light kept me nimble.",[149,2882,2883],{},"I packed up my things and slung the bag over my shoulder. I began to move toward the door but remembered to feed the fish first. When the food hit their water, the three of them shifted to a pleasant magenta, and they began to feast. I flipped the switch on the light and stumbled my way through my dark apartment. Furniture had to be inventively placed in a space as small as this, and walking it blind was an exercise in memory.",[149,2885,2886],{},"At the front hatch, I pressed the unseal button and waited for it to depressurize. I winced as my eyes adjusted to the brightness of the hazy morning. The cloud cover was heavy enough that it didnât take long, but for a moment everything seemed so bright. I was now outside, on top of the scaffolding that stretched alongside rows and columns of improvised housing that stretched along the docks. Iâd seen one of my neighbors take a nasty spill on a rusted-out step, so I always went down slowly. Inspectors didnât often make their way out here.",[149,2888,2889],{},"I passed by Old Man Rorik, sitting with his airlock open and horn music coming from inside the unit. He gave me a nod and a smile but didnât say much else. We were a neighborhood, but a lot of us kept to ourselves. Most of us preferred it that way.Â ",[149,2891,2892],{},"Overall, I enjoyed my time there, and it was as affordable as New Bekton went. Some rent control policies from the old administration were still in effect. My unit was one of the cheapest in the city, which worked for my strange and inconsistent income. My landlord was as nice as a housing baron could be, he even cut a hundred off my rent when he learned I was a former Royalist. There werenât many friends of the Empire in this ring of the city.Â ",[149,2894,2895],{},"At the bottom of the scaffolding, the dock was a mix of mercrete and metal plating. New Bekton was a city on an island, which placed a limit on its growth. To avoid unnecessary infrastructure spending, the old Royal government sanctioned a group of piers to become emergency housing. That was 70 years ago, and any chance of a permanent solution under the new Imperial government was even less likely than under those before them. Pier 17 a fact of life. It wasnât always the worst thing that it was.Â ",[149,2897,2898],{},"I crossed the dock to a group of skimmers. Vehicles that resembled a larger brass tube and a smaller steel tube fused together. Some of my neighbors were rich enough to own one of them, sectioned off in a private parking lot. Otherwise, the floating cars were the property of the Wakenfern Transit Authority. I picked the one closest to me and got inside. The interior was fairly simple, with a bit of graffiti on the dash. Certainly, it was clean and comfortable enough, albeit barebones. The radio worked, and that was enough for me.",[149,2900,2901],{},"I flipped to Dr. Swellâs show, now interviewing an ash farmer. I caught the conversation in the middle so I didnât entirely get what was happening, but it seemed that they were discussing the ethics of a new alchemical pesticide used on ash yams. Specifically, its effect on the wine supply. Yam wine was a wasteland staple, the segment would do quite well.Â ",[149,2903,2904],{},"I reached for the ignition, a hole a couple of inches wide next to the control stick. I stuck my left finger in and winced as the needle pierced my skin. I withdrew my finger and held it tight while the machine processed my reading. I had registered when I got my license, like most kids. It would reference my genetic material and charge it to my account. I couldnât remember my balance but I was certain I had enough for the day. Â ",[149,2906,2907],{},"The simple dashboard display scrolled a âWelcomeâ to an old name I mentally blurred out. âEnjoy your ride!â and the vehicle hummed to life. I buckled in and flipped the brake lock. With a slight lurch, the skimmer lifted off the ground, orienting with me in the brass passenger tube on top, and the propulsion tube on bottom. I did a quick check for other vehicles, drone traffic, and everything else they train you to be worried about in flight school. I pulled the stick and began the climb to travel altitude.Â ",[149,2909,222],{},[149,2911,2912],{},"From the aerial vantage point, it became apparent why New Bekton was called The City of Rings. The island city was comprised of three tiered circles, ascending towards the center. The messy outer ring, Lowtown, is where I had spent most of my adult life. The middle ring, Midtown, was corporations, entertainment, and academia. Government and religious institutions centered in the highest Uptown ring. At the center of it all was a massive spire that shot past the environmental shield, the cloudline, the sky, and into the void, thus named the Voidspire. Lights were everywhere, and the airspace was smothered with traffic. The city strained against its island constraints, but somehow there was always a little more room for another development.Â ",[149,2914,2915],{},"Different parts of the city had their own unique energies. Pier 17 was a fairly chill place where people lay low. The same could be said of the adjacent South Lowtown, which had other low-income housing. North Lowtown was different. It was no nicer than any other part of the outer ring. The affluent parts of the city were the middle and center. However, the people in North Lowtown were hungrier than their southern counterparts. They had more drive. A day in the North Lowtown shops was always a pleasure.",[149,2917,2918],{},"I left my rental at another rental station and started walking. I kept my head down to avoid the constant stream of poster ads, something you learned to do if you wanted to get through a walk on city streets without a panic attack. I stayed close to the sidewalk's edge, doing my best to stay out of the way. Several buildings on the street had been closed down in a police raid. I craned my neck and looked for uniforms. Imperial blues, not New Bekton Law Enforcement olive. They were grabbing people for questioning. Best to get moving quickly. I darted a sharp right down the recently renamed Courage Lane, part of the new adminâs initiative to promote patriotism.Â ",[149,2920,2921],{},"There were a few nice businesses here, I often went down Courage to shop on an off day. The Azure Cat bar played soft Nur Fasaani folk music out of its opened airlock to my left. A young woman with spliced-on gills and a clipboard started to talk to me about corp recruitment. I made that hand gesture that was polite enough to acknowledge the person but firmly communicated âNot today.â My eyes wandered over a couple of pop-up market stalls that called to passersby on the right. I eyed a particularly cute doll in one of their displays, but the pathetic jingle in my coin purse reminded me that I didnât have enough money for a detour. I frowned, then shrugged. Those stalls hiked up their prices anyway. The shop I needed lay just beyond.",[149,2923,2924],{},"Korvunâs Finest Apothecary was an unassuming old house that had been converted into a storefront through some questionably legal remodeling. Zealously placed signs advertised it as âNew Bektonâs premier apothecarium.â They often opened late so I was hoping I had not come too early. The flashing âOpenâ sign rewarded my faith. I pressed the bright red button on the airlock and waited for it to cycle. These commercial ones were required to be larger than personal units like the one on the front of my place, unsealing them often took longer.Â ",[149,2926,2927],{},"The airlock opened and I entered into a small waiting room with a bunch of lockers and seats. Â Most commercial buildings were required to offer shelter in the event of environmental shield failure. The interior chamber of the airlock had the painted image of a small plant rising out of a pile of dirt, colorful little bulbs hinting at fruit to come. It was a cute logo, I figured the shopkeeper's child made it, apparently, they were going for an art degree at the cityâs premier University.Â ",[149,2929,2930],{},"Inside, the storefront was arranged to promote serenity. There was no overhead lighting. Instead, what illumination there was came from the interior lining of glass cases filled with plants. The lights were a celadon green, and cast a vibrant glow across the room, a thematic attempt at representing moonlight. In the shadows, menacingly lit by the lowered lighting was a tall and lumbering figure. I heard the metal floor thud and clack with heavy clawed steps as they approached me.Â ",[149,2932,2933],{},"I smiled and looked up, they were a couple of feet taller than me. âMorning Haela!â I said warmly. Haela was good people. They were a Primas-ika, tall and bulky reptiles. Their scales were a light grey but shone green in the light. Their curved horns were slightly outlined and the gold caps on them reflected a little shine, and their long false hair was braided around their shoulders. Haela smiled, revealing a mouth full of glistening sharp teeth. âAlice, my girl! Howâs your week been?â",[149,2935,2936],{},"âAh you know how it is, a couple jobs here and there. Howâs the shop?â",[149,2938,2939],{},"This exchange was fairly routine. We talked about our days, my days in Pier 17, my social life, their work, their childâs career, and more. Haela began to retrieve my usual medication. They pulled out a couple of jars of different colored herbs and began to powder them up with an old-fashioned mortar and pestle. I enjoyed Haelaâs shop for the focus on artisanal craftship at fairly reasonable prices. Whatâs more, not many people were experts on my condition, especially ones that I could afford without insurance.",[149,2941,2942],{},"Â âSoâ¦â Haela signaled the change in subject to more direct business, âHave you been spending more time outside the shield?â",[149,2944,2945],{},"The dim light of the room hid me from paling.

I chose to leave it at the assurance.Â ",[149,2965,2966],{},"Haela sighed, âOf course. Iâm going to add some Moranâs Root to your supplements. It promotes respiratory health.

Â âMaybe Iâll win the lottery and kick it in Nur Fasaan.â We both did that little small talk laugh where nothing said was very funny but we were trying to keep it light.

It was rare, one in ten thousand humans was born without the ability to process advanced alchemy and augmentations. The things that kept most city-dwellers healthy without natural sunlight or good food sources. Doctors didnât give me long. I wasnât supposed to live long past 20. The gods had been kind to me, and I tried to repay that gift with my service when I could.Â ",[149,2980,2981],{},"My parents had been protective of me growing up, I wasnât allowed to do much because they were worried Iâd get hurt in some way that I couldnât fix without a potion. Though they were proud of me for signing onto the Astaelian Royal Army, they had frequently urged me to take a support role. They went overseas during the war and never found out about my arm. I almost bled out because the medic didnât know how to apply normal bandaging without a healing salve to seal the wound.Â ",[149,2983,2984],{},"Haela would sometimes check the scar and apply ointments and creams to try to return the skin to normal.

Some chemically assisted surgery here and there. I wasnât so lucky, I had to rely on direct hormone replacement and old-fashioned surgical techniques. It was my life, though. I liked living, and it wasnât like I was going to give up my identity. Haela was great for that too, with old-school know-how and the biolab they had in the back.",[149,2992,2993],{},"By most observations, I was healthier than most organics and I credited that to the apothecaryâs amazing work. They were not cheap, which I was reminded of as I handed a small pile of crystalline coins to Haela. They did the math, made changes, and we said our goodbyes. On the way out I stopped by the little shrine to Iudan, The Healer. I whispered a small prayer of thanks for the bounty. Haela went back to work and I slipped out the door.Â ",[149,2995,2996],{},"I walked out of Haelaâs shopâs airlock and popped one of the pills. I washed it down with my canteen.

Natural hemp was in no way addictive, but I relied on it to drown out a background radiation of anxiety that came with the fast-paced New Bekton life. I took my first drag and exhaled into the air as pedestrians avoided me.

I cursed my illness, that I couldnât transition like others, with their fancy chems and surgeries. I cursed myself for forgetting to shave that morning and wearing such a masculine jacket. I cursed the gods that would put me in this wretched form and insist I live with it.

I was just glad this was a friendly face, the worst-case scenarios that had been flooding my mind drifted away. âAlice, my name is Alice now.

The world had ended more than once and still kept going.Â ",[149,3143,3144],{},"I tuned the radio to Dr. Swellâs frequency, now in the nighttime show. Swell had been dealing with fatigue so heâd delegated the nightly music show to his apprentice, a mysterious figure who went by The Fizz. The Fizz lacked the manic energy of his teacher, but always had an interesting fact to share about the artist playing.

It didnât matter who I was here, trans, Organic, ex-Royalist, whatever. I could just live. I remembered Haelaâs words, and popped the Moranâs Root pills that I washed down with my canteen, and carried on foot for a while.Â ",[149,3152,3153],{},"In the stillness of the night, it was just locusts and the clicking of my filtered mask. Technically, the area I was entering was the property of the church, but I wasnât in the market for any divine artifacts. My target was a derelict vessel from the Parathan Imperial era. Hundreds of years ago they had heralded the age of alchemy that we still lived in. An unsalvaged vehicle could be host to so many rare finds. Iâd pay my rent for months. If it was military, it might have had some stuff for TarâIlâs front, too.",[149,3155,3156],{},"I flipped a light on my face mask and peered into a crevasse formed by a seismic event. Sure enough, there it was. Made sense why it wasnât found. I thanked the gods for my good fortune and wriggled my way in. I heard a clicking noise. Not my rebreather. I froze, feeling my heart nearly pound out of its chest. Random debris? No, that was a trigger. I looked down, staying as still as I could. I looked down, my left foot was stepping on something metal, brass, cylindrical. Recognition snapped into place and I shambled my way out of the opening as fast as I could. Grenade, grenade, grenade.",[149,3158,3159],{},"It all happened in a matter of seconds and then came the energy blast. Enough of me got out that I didnât die in the detonation immediately.

Half-cauterized by the heat of the explosion. I collapsed, my consciousness fading quickly. I realized my head was resting against something, something firm.

She ran for a day straight, pursued by them. Two of them, in dark cloaks that concealed their forms. One was short, one was tall. On the second day, they almost caught her. She lost them long enough to sleep, but soon they were back on her trail. She thought for a second they might try to talk to her. The burning heat of a bullet in her right side dissuaded this illusion.",[149,3462,3463],{},"She needed to get away. Some petrified trees stood to her left, too sparse for cover. She rounded a bend. A ditch was coming up on her right. She checked behind her, but no one yet. She threw herself down. The landing was rough and the hideous pain from the wound in her shoulder almost made her cry out. It took all her discipline to bite her tongue and keep quiet. She tumbled and ashy mud covered her face wrappings and blotted out her vision. Desperately, she crawled her weakened self underneath a lip of the road above that formed a slight overhang from where she lay.",[149,3465,3466],{},"Mira stayed low and repeated silent prayers to herself. She ran her fingers along an amulet of the 11-pointed star of the Divine Council. With her other arm, she clutched her bag jealousy toward her breast like a mother protecting her child. Ichor from her wound seeped into her protective gear and onto the ground below her. Heavy boots beat against the dirt road above her. Voices muffled by rebreathers exclaimed in frustration that their quarry had eluded them. She put her mouth over her own respirator and tried to hold her breath. She couldnât get caught. She was too close to her goal. At long last the end of her journey.Â ",[149,3468,3469],{},"They passed by. She stayed there a while longer. When she was sure the predators had lost their scent, she wriggled herself out from under the overhang and climbed back onto the road. She fell to her knees, having grown lightheaded. How much blood had she lost? The thought flitted from her mind. She stood with a wobble and looked up. The sky above was the color and texture of slate stone. A reminder from the Divine Council that the people of Vian had grown so distant from their light.Â ",[149,3471,3472],{},"She stopped to examine her injury. The bullet had torn straight through. Her understanding of mortal anatomy was strong enough to know it must have barely missed an artery. With some rough bandaging, she managed to stop the worst of it. The gods were good and she would live long enough to get to her destination. However, she needed care quickly, lest it be a martyrâs journey.",[149,3474,3475],{},"Next, she opened her bag and checked on her treasure. It was a cylindrical canister sealed by cryogenic technologies. A view window showed the contents within, two pristine eyes. A small indicator light flashed green, indicating it was safe but out of ideal conditions. Even the cold of the wasteland she wandered in was not enough for this frozen container. This was everything she had spent the last year trying to find. She had already sent word to her people that she was returning victorious.",[149,3477,3478],{},"She put it back carefully and slung her bag over her good shoulder. The road branched off to a side trail, which she took to avoid running into her pursuers again. They would try to take her prize from her, but she would not let them. She would not let anyone touch what she had been trusted with.",[149,3480,3481],{},"Fatigue scraped against a wall of willpower in Miraâs mind. She had carried on foot for weeks.

Her bandages had soaked through, staining her mottled cloth overwraps to a muted scarlet. Her willpower carried her there, but dizziness overtook her. She limped into line and kept jabbing her leg to stay awake. No one paid her any mind. Desperate situations at the cityâs entrance were no strange occurrence.Â ",[149,3492,3493],{},"She wondered if they would just watch as she bled out. No. She couldnât. She was so close. Maybe someone from the enclave could come meet her. Would they even know where she is? How could she reach them? The Divines had protected her journey up to this point. They just needed to keep their hands over her for a little longer.Â ",[149,3495,3496],{},"She got to the front of the line, and a customs agent in cobalt blue sealed armor asked for her identification, business, and everything else they did in the process. She took her bag off her unwounded shoulder and searched for an ID. When she handed it over, she realized she had smudged it in blood. The customs officer barely noticed. He scrawled some information down on a clipboard. She managed to get out that she was returning home with a delivery. When asked what she was carrying, she remembered the Fatherâs warning to identify it as familial relics.Â ",[149,3498,3499],{},"Of course, he demanded a fee. There were dark spots in her vision as if she was viewing the world through a cardboard tube. She got the money out of her bagâs wallet pouch and handed it over.

Her breathing was shallow and fast. She made it inside the opened gate, though not much further. She slumped against a divider near customs, but an officer pushed her back with the butt of a rifle.

She couldnât lead them to the enclave, too risky. She could face them directly, but they had tried to take her life once before and she saw no reason they wouldnât try again. While she would gladly become a martyr for her faith, she still had the eyes. They had to stay safe. She clutched her amulet and prayed for guidance. The clattering of rats across metal scrap drew her attention to an alleyway. It was filled with junk and debris, likely from the renovation of the adjoining tailor shop. It was perfect.Â ",[149,3801,3802],{},"She ducked behind a couple laborers carrying a couch, and slid into the alleyway, hopefully unseen. Immediately she began searching for a place to stash the treasure. A pile of opened crates, a broken drone, construction materials, andâ¦ Gods are kind! An old cooler, with perfect insulation. She opened her bag and started to hide the canister, then she heard footsteps at the entrance to the alley.Â ",[149,3804,3805],{},"She turned to see who it was, though on some level she already knew. Two hooded figures, one tall and one short skulked towards her. âWhat you got there?â the shorter one said, in a cool, smooth voice. Like ice.Â ",[149,3807,3808],{},"The tall one spoke next, âReckon sheâs got something mighty special to protect it all this way.â",[149,3810,3811],{},"The short one looked at the tall one, âThink itâs something the Master would want?â He lowered his hood, revealing a bald head covered in profane tattoos. References to some heathen god that Mira couldnât identify. A gore-covered hand.",[149,3813,3814],{},"The tall one lowered their hood, revealing the scales, horns, and braided hair of a Primas-ika. âUndoubtedly. Something this precious? Would go a long way in his service.â",[149,3816,3817],{},"They both looked back at her, âSo, surely you wonât mind if we take a peek, miss?â",[149,3819,3820],{},"She clutched the cooler in her arms and tried to work up courage. She yelled, âStay back!â",[149,3822,3823],{},"The shorter one laughed, âI donât think youâre in the position to be giving orders.â He flashed steel under his robe, attached to his hip. The same pistol that had wounded her before, surely. âNow last time, you got away, but weâre a lot closer now. Donât think Iâd fuck up twice.âÂ ",[149,3825,3826],{},"She was breathing heavily as he drew the pistol, a revolver. Her mind ran through scriptures for wisdom in a time like this, all she could recall was the command to be defiant to your enemies. âI saidâ¦ stay back.â",[149,3828,3829],{},"Both the dark-robed figures laughed this time, âThe bravery! They donât make disciples like you anymore. Tell me, lady, who do you serve?â",[149,3831,3832],{},"She thought for a second to declare herself a proud Cyranite, then reconsidered. They may have caught her, but she could keep the enclave safe with her silence. She bit her tongue.Â ",[149,3834,3835],{},"âNothing to say, eh?â The shorter one stepped closer. âWell, let me make this a little easier on you. Weâre leaving with those eyes youâre carrying. They donât belong to you or whatever cloister you serve. The only real difference is if youâll give them to us orâ¦â the hammer on the gun clicked.Â ",[149,3837,3838],{},"Mira sat there, defeated. Her journey seemed at an end. She could not return to her enclave after so much time empty-handed. She could not face these foul acolytes directly. She was caught, and she accepted her fate. She began to pray out loud.Â ",[149,3840,3841],{},"The shorter one stopped for a second, and eyed her, âNow now, you can tell them everything in person soon enough.âÂ ",[149,3843,3844],{},"In a moment of serendipity, the side door to the tailor shop swung open. An old human woman burst onto the stoop, âWhoâs making all that-â",[149,3846,3847],{},"She was cut short by a gunshot from the shorter man, who swung around in surprise. Mira couldnât see if the old lady, who was out of view from her vantage behind the open door, was hit. She saw surprise and fear in the shorter manâs tattooed face. She knew this was her only chance.Â ",[149,3849,3850],{},"Mira was not strong, not even in the slightest. Yet in that moment, the fury of the gods flowed through her, and she charged all the weight and force she had into the manâs torso. Maybe he was still surprised, or maybe she was more mighty than she thought. Either way, he went tumbling back into a pile of debris.Â ",[149,3852,3853],{},"His landing was met with the sickening tearing of flesh and meat into metal. A rogue piece of rebar protruded from his chest, where the heart would be on a normal human. He spasmed and spat blood from his mouth. He looked at Mira and began to utter something in a foul language that she didnât recognize. He was cut short, more red fell from his open mouth and his body went slack.Â ",[149,3855,3856],{},"Miraâs hands were trembling. She had never killed before. It was a sin unless ordained by the Council. She hadnât meant toâ¦",[149,3858,3859],{},"The tall one, the Primas-ika, looked at their dead companion, and back to Mira. They let out a furious battle cry, and they charged Mira. Before she could even process it, a barbed scaly fist tore into her face. She reeled back. The tall cultist brought two fists down on the crown of her head. The impact concussed her, and the huge person pushed her to the ground.",[149,3861,3862],{},"On the ground, she received several more blows, punches, and kicks. In the daze, and through the pain, she wondered if this was it. Her chance at salvation was blown. Then she didnât think anything at all. She thought she saw a glint of light, like the one they said those saw on the journey to Atharas. She crawled towards it, and reached for it, ready to receive her eternal reward.Â ",[149,3864,3865],{},"She gripped it and it was cold like metal. It was small but heavy in her hands. Not at all what she expected of the afterlife. She was beyond coherent thought, but her impulses took over for her. She rolled on her back just as the tall one prepared to stomp on her ribs. She found the trigger and fired. The tall one halted. She fired again, and this time they fell.Â ",[149,3867,3868],{},"She lay there a while, pools of blood intermingling. She stared at the purple hexagonal sky, below the rolling clouds that smothered their broken world. If this world had any hope, she carried it in that cryo container. Was she doomed to die here? She was hurt badly, and there was no doctor to save her this time. She considered crying out, but her broken ribs made that an impossibility. Plus, she was a killer now. She could not be caught while she still had a delivery to make. She would have to pay her penance at the compound.",[149,3870,3871],{},"After minutes of effort, she got to her feet. She got her bag, now covered in the Primas-ikaâs vital fluids. She retrieved the eyes and ensured they were okay. The green light flashed. Mira considered stopping to burn the dead, as was customary. She limped by the door and checked for what she thought would be the corpse of the old woman. The old lady was there, still alive and breathing heavily. She clutched a wound in her hip and leaned against the interior of the door. When she saw Mira, they both made panicked eye contact. The old woman began to shout, and Mira knew she couldnât stay there.Â ",[149,3873,3874],{},"Half limping, half running, she stumbled out of the alley and began to make as straight of a line as possible for the enclave.

Others had already gathered and made way for Mira as she went to the front. The doorway was concealed, but in the shadows, she saw a figure shifting. She leaned against the podium, smearing blood on it. All the work of Doc Vili was wasted. She wouldnât last long and she knew it. In a way, she felt some serene peace with this. She had made it to the Sanctum. That was all she had to do.Â ",[149,3941,3942],{},"From the entrance, a shape ducked out. He was radiant, beautiful, and perfect.

Most of his limbs were like tendrils and bent and contorted in ways that would be impossible for any other mortal.

Each of us was made for a purpose. The whole of Vian was. We feel it in our hearts, in our souls. There is no greater calling than service in the name of the gods. You know this, it is what drew you to our humble community. Our great curse is to be deprived of this assurance.

It was too late, no healing potion would save her now. Instead, they pushed a syringe of light blue fluid into her neck and pressed the plunger. A cool rush ran through her head and body as the stimulant took effect. Her wounds still hurt, and her blood still poured from her wounds. Yet her pain was lessened and her mind was clearer.Â ",[149,3977,3978],{},"She looked up to the Father, who stood over her. He spoke again, âFind your strength and arise, Sister Mira.

Then there was quiet for some time.Â ",[149,4001,4002],{},"The three waited and waited for some time longer than that. Then Father Cyranâs new eyes opened, red and shiny as rubies.

Over a shirt and patched sweater you fitted on a thick, grey hide jacket. Like most open-air wasteland travelers, your face was concealed by a protective rebreather system.

Their job was more regulating incoming traffic than preventing departures. Traderâs Sanctuary was a ramshackle series of prefabricated buildings sealed by airlocks, with poisoned air and ash strewn streets. It was no mystery to anyone why someone would want to leave.

Heavy, soot-filled clouds formed a thick ceiling above you. It was bright enough that you knew it was day, but you powered on an electric lantern for extra light.

You were good at your job, or at least thatâs how you liked to imagine yourself.Â ",[149,4211,4212],{},"The main highway was populated, but sparsely.

Much cheaper than the shops in town. You got some extra food for your horse and yourself. You also grabbed a small supply of Sight from one. You packed a bit of it in with your normal polyspice and rolled them as cigarettes for later.",[149,4217,4218],{},"Further out from town, the highway traffic became sparse. Ruins still dotted the broken terrain, but increasingly few settlements rose to replace them. The world had once been teeming with life hundreds of years ago, but there was so much less of it now.Â ",[149,4220,4221],{},"You rode carefully and eyed the rocks, bushes, and dilapidated buildings for anything that seemed a little off. Logically, you knew most people meant you no harm. Yet a lifetime of crime media and 24- hour news cycles, mixed with a few poignant anecdotes from those in your professional circle, encouraged a persistent background radiation of paranoia.Â ",[149,4223,4224],{},"There was a flash of light overhead, followed by the rumbling roll of thunder. You remembered the forecast calling for a storm, but it was several hours early. Your eyes scanned for potential shelter, and then you knew that you were no longer alone.",[149,4226,4227],{},"Another flash of light illuminated him. One man, alone on a motorcycle jutting out somewhat into the road from behind the gentle cover of brambled shrubbery. You saw him too late, and he rolled out to block the road. An electric tension shot down your spine and you pulled the reins in on your horse until you stopped.Â ",[149,4229,4230],{},"The stranger spoke with a raised voice over heavy winds and the mechanical purr of the engine. His voice was smooth and viscous. Not like honey but rather slime, âGood evening!â",[149,4232,4233],{},"You said nothing. Not at first. The stranger spoke with the calm of someone greeting a neighbor on the street, but that made you all the more wary. You eyed potential routes of escape, but they were all visible and unlikely to outrun a motor vehicle.",[149,4235,4236],{},"He dismounted and walked towards you. In the light of your lantern he was revealed. Tall, shaped like a human, but you couldnât be sure beneath the layers of jet black clothing that concealed his body and face. His walk was strained, not like he was pained, but like how a child takes steps in their fatherâs clothes that were several sizes too large. You did not find it endearing, though. You were too focused on the snub shotgun attached to his hip.",[149,4238,4239],{},"He wore purple goggles that glowed from underneath the brim of his hat. For a second he regarded you. You looked around for anyone else on the road. No one. He spoke again, slowly, âNow why are you out here all by yourself? Itâs safer to travel with friends, ainât it?âÂ ",[149,4241,4242],{},"You said you were on an errand, and that it was faster to travel on your own. This was true, though in this moment you longed for the safety of companionship.",[149,4244,4245],{},"âWould that errand have anything to do with that cube youâre hauling?â He looked at the cargo on the back and saddlebags of the horse, and backed up a couple steps, careful of the beastâs barbed tail.",[149,4247,4248],{},"The tension in your spine turned to chills, and your face went hot. You thought quickly and said no, and insisted that it was provisions given to you by a traveling mission. You were not a great liar under pressure, but this was as plausible as you could have managed.",[149,4250,4251],{},"âOh, is that so? Well Iâve been running a little low on supplies myself. It looks like you have plenty.â He gestured to the rations you got from the caravan. âMaybe youâd let me take that box off your hands. It looks awfully bulky.â",[149,4253,4254],{},"You refused, and insisted you needed everything you had for the long journey ahead.Â ",[149,4256,4257],{},"The man let out a long sigh, or what seemed like it was meant to be a sigh. The noise was wet and guttural, as if a drowning last breath but in open dry air. âThatâ¦ will not do.â",[149,4259,4260],{},"You grabbed the reins of your horse, and tapped one of its horns to signal it to start moving. You began to maneuver around the stopped bike. The man said your name. Not your callsign. Not the fake names you give when you stay in town. He said your actual name. You stopped dead and turned around. He was holding the shotgun now, and the veneer of roadside conversation gave way to the reality of the situation.Â ",[149,4262,4263],{},"You stopped the horse and dismounted. You held your hands up. Scenarios played in your mind. The client had been very clear that losing this package would be as good as dying. The Church had agents everywhere, you wouldnât be able to run. What of this man? Were there others of his kind? You got the impression he would gun you down without remorse or thought. So, you were dead in that scenario, too. You could give him the box and run, but who was to say he wouldnât kill you anyway? There was one option, a last resort.Â ",[149,4265,4266],{},"You agreed to the highwaymanâs demands and began to make your way to unfasten the straps holding the box in place. You considered asking how he knew your name, but the curiosity was buried by the material threat.Â Â ",[149,4268,4269],{},"Another flash of lightning overhead. Just what you were waiting for. You reached into your jacket and pulled out a pistol, already loaded. You spun around and fired just as the thunderclap responded. The blast left a crater in the manâs torso, and threw him back to the ground, twitching. His gun fired into the air aimlessly, a futile gesture of defense.Â ",[149,4271,4272],{},"Blood spattered the dirt and plants, and the body spasmed a couple more times. You averted your gaze and tried to calm your shallow breath. Your horse had panicked from the shot and ran off into the distance. You were outside of your body, watching the scene from some upper vantage point. You acted without your mind, and dragged the body- now surely dead- off to the side of the road.Â ",[149,4274,4275],{},"It was mandated by faith and law to burn the dead, even if you were the killer. Of course, no court or sheriff would ever hold you to account for what you did. You were no murderer, just a person protecting yourself. Nonetheless, the task of burning the body and releasing the soul of the dead fell to you. You went off to secure your horse and retrieve a cremation capsule from your supplies, but you never came back.Â ",[149,4277,4278],{},"Maybe it was the looming storm and the beginning of the rain. Maybe you figured another traveler on the main road would take care of it, maybe a traveling priest of death. Maybe you just said fuck it. After all, this man would have gladly mowed you down. Why did he deserve your courtesy? So you left him there to rot.",[149,4280,4281],{},"You left his bike too, though you considered taking it with you. You remembered a delivery girl they called Siren who had stolen a vehicle from a law officer she had successfully overpowered. She had been tracked down and hung using some internal locator on the vehicle. You didnât know what organization the man you killed belonged to, but you didnât want to take the chance that they would be similarly prepared. You took your horse and your things and you left.",[149,4283,222],{},[149,4285,4286],{},"You carried on the main road for a while, but a gnawing paranoia overtook you. Who was that man? How did he know your name? Were there others, and would they know where to find you?Â ",[149,4288,4289],{},"You took the first fork in the road that you saw heading in the same approximate direction. This branch was less well kept, less trodden. It was littered with debris, and you might have lost the path were it not guided by an occasional splash of red paint against the rocks lining the sides.",[149,4291,4292],{},"Come to think of it, you had never seen this road before. You pulled open a map of the south you kept on hand, and found the intersection where the fork would be.Â  There was nothing. You checked again, and checked the publication date on your map. It was a recent enough copy. No sign of this road. It wasnât unheard of, for side roads made by locals to not make the official record, but you clung tighter to the reins anyway.",[149,4294,4295],{},"The rain began in earnest, unforgivingly acidic. You stopped, covered the supplies and package with a tarp. You worked on a thick plastic-polymer poncho. It did not cover you entirely, but enough to be safe from the caustic downpour that was to follow.",[149,4297,4298],{},"It did follow, and the skies opened up over the plains. The rain beat an improvised rhythm on the road, yourself, and the hardened mutated hide of your horse. It started in that almost musical percussive way, but soon the torrent drowned out all else. If it kept up, you would need to find shelter.",[149,4300,4301],{},"You carried on for an hour, the toxic sludge that formed on the ground squelched and splashed beneath the reinforced hooves of your steed. You thought about the rains where you grew up. You had grown up on a farm, growing yams for a nearby city. Your whole family was part of the trade, along with several others. You worked closely with your brother managing a harvester. You did this for a great deal of time, but wanderlust had always tugged at your heart. Your life was elsewhere. When your brotherâs accident happened- or at least you told yourself it was an accident- you wasted no time putting in your notice and you rode as far away as you could in a single week.Â ",[149,4303,4304],{},"It had been years since that day. Some part of you missed the relative safety and comfort of that life. The larger part of you, even when traversing through the grime and mud of some forgotten road, would never look back for a second.Â ",[149,4306,4307],{},"Though, you did look back in a more literal sense. First you noticed the scarlet paint on the rocks was washing off. Was that paint? Over the rain a hum could be heard, louder and louder. A rumble like thunder but too quiet for that. You turned your head and your jaw went slack. In the distance, but clearly enough, you saw the shadowed outline of a figure on a bike riding toward you.Â ",[149,4309,4310],{},"There was no way it was him, you had certainly sunk enough lead in that manâs body that even redundant vital organ implants wouldnât have saved him. You destroyed him. Yet that bike was coming right towards you, the rider with those damned luminescent purple goggles. There was no one else on this road, and he was gaining.Â ",[149,4312,4313],{},"You did not wait to confirm your suspicions, you kicked the side of your horse and broke into a sprint as fast and far down the road as you could. It was no use, the motorcycle was going to overtake you. Your eyes scanned the horizon for terrain to go into. A petrified forest gave the most obvious hope of escape. Your heart pounded with the beating hooves beneath you. You cleared into the forest and maneuvered at top speed around long dead trees.",[149,4315,4316],{},"You were looking back to confirm you were making distance. You didnât see the stray root in front of you. The horse let out a hideous whine of pain and tumbled into the ground, launching you forward. You rolled head first into a log, and the world went black.",[149,4318,4319],{},"You did not die there, not yet. Though the blinding pain you woke up to made you wish you had. When you came to and the confusion settled, your hands went to your face, and you felt the blood soaking your coverings. You could barely breathe through your broken nose. You panted out of your mouth raggedly and your heart and head pounded in sadistic unison. A terrible noise was coming from not too far away from you. You sloshed out of the soggy ground and sat against the log to get a better view of the scene.",[149,4321,4322],{},"The bike was nowhere to be seen. You had lost him, or whoever that was, but your horse was crying out in pain. Two of its legs were apparently broken. You felt a twinge of sadness for it, then a rush of fear as you knew that your pursuer might hear. You crawled through the mud over to the beast. Only your nose had been broken but the pain in your body was too intense for you to stand on your own.Â ",[149,4324,4325],{},"You got next to the beast and stayed clear of the poison barbed tail that thrashed wildly around its hindquarters. A knife went uneasily into the creatureâs hardened throat, and with some effort on your end you managed to sever its major veins and arteries. The equine blood you were sprayed with merged with your own and your clothes had become a macabre showcase of reds and browns. The horse looked at you with terror in its eyes, it did not understand what had happened to it, or why it had to die now. It kicked and spasmed, and its eyes rolled into its head. It died scared, and you looked away to spare yourself the guilt that bubbled within you.Â ",[149,4327,4328],{},"When it was quiet, and when the pain you felt became manageable, you made yourself stand. You assessed yourself for wounds. Nothing serious, though youâd need to apply some healing formula to a gash on your nose, and your hip where you snagged a branch. You collected the crate and whatever supplies you could carry. You made camp there that night, carefully. Then you wandered out.",[149,4330,4331],{},"It occurred to you that you werenât sure which direction you were going. The gnarled brambles and broken trees didnât give much in the way of landmarks. You thought you identified a unique formation of a fallen tree balanced on the limbs of two others, but there were at least two other instances of that. You kept limping until eventually in the distance you saw buildings. You thanked the gods and pressed forward.Â ",[149,4333,4334],{},"The structures were unusual, antiquated. Wood siding, hatch roofs, windows. No visible airlocks outside of any of them, though youâd heard that some recent designs had tried to obscure those. You approached, the weight of your gear on your back and the box in your hands compelling you to rest.Â ",[149,4336,4337],{},"You collapsed near a well, another antiquated design. No machinery you could see. Were they really just pumping water from the ground unfiltered? Maybe they had filters in the houses themselves.Â ",[149,4339,4340],{},"You craned your neck toward the town, two rows of houses down a main street. Not a single shop, bar, town hall, or anything else youâd expect to see. Isolated settlements werenât unusual, but to have nothing besides housing was odd. A faint mist crept at the fringes and swallowed the distance. Leftover from the rains perhaps.Â ",[149,4342,4343],{},"Â You tried to figure out what kind of place this was, and then you heard the laughter of children approaching. They rounded the well and you saw them. 5 children dressed for St. Draliaâs Day, monsters and popular figures from all across the world. Their leader wore a red cape and a mask that bore the image of one of those titanic lizards from out west, a drak. You blinked and rubbed your eyes. You wondered if it was already St. Draliaâs Day. You wondered further why the kids werenât wearing any apparent breathing protection in the open air.Â ",[149,4345,4346],{},"They stared a while longer, and you stared back. The one in the drak mask pointed and spoke, âBloody rags!â and started to laugh. The other kids began to laugh and sing along, âBloody rags! Bloody rags!â They circled the well a couple of times, dancing and chanting their song. You got to your feet and began to walk. The mist had intensified but you could see everything within settlement, more or less.Â ",[149,4348,4349],{},"They pursued you briefly but then broke off to a house. They knocked on the door. An adult in normal clothes opened the door and passed treats out to the assorted receptacles held by the kids. You looked back, and when they were done, the adult just stared at you. Face blank, eyes filled with something you couldnât identify, but made you walk faster.",[149,4351,4352],{},"The process repeated, groups of kids rang doorbells across the street, treats were passed out, and the occupants of the houses just stared at you. You were not too far from civilization, or at least you didnât think you were. These people acted like they hadnât seen an outsider in months. Years maybe. You resolved within yourself to clear this town and get back to the main road. You wanted to ask for directions, but you felt youâd find no answers here. The mist was consuming you now.Â ",[149,4354,4355],{},"As you approached the edge of town the kids encircled you again. There were more of them now. Their song had developed, albeit tunelessly. âBloody rags! Bloody rags! Walk a winding road, but there youâll find your end.â You stood silently as they encircled you. From behind, the adults had gathered without protective gear, forming a stoic wall that blocked you from entering town again.Â ",[149,4357,4358],{},"The mist overtook visuals, and the singing grew louder. âBloody rags! Bloody rags! Thought you killed him, but there youâll find your end!â You clutched your things and tried to find an escape but it had grown so thick you couldnât even see a few feet in front of you. Your heart pounded and there was this gnawing chill down your spine. You hadnât been seen when you killed him, when you didnât burn him. You were sure of it. Did someone tell them?Â ",[149,4360,4361],{},"The fog cleared, the singing faded into the distance, and you were alone. No sign of the costumed children, no sign of the mob of adults, and the town that had once been restored and full of life had turned dilapidated and ancient. Long abandoned, and its inhabitants long dead or their descendants moved to a safer location. You were alone on a barren stretch of the wasteland, not far from a road.Â ",[149,4363,4364],{},"You were paralyzed, the events of the last twenty minutes played through your head on repeat. There was no such thing as ghosts, you were sure of that. Though, you were increasingly less sure. You lit one of your cigarettes from the yasre caravan, and let the harmonious melody of buzz and high take you.",[149,4366,4367],{},"When it was burnt down, you carried on for a few hours more in the dark. The Sight you smoked let you move without a lantern, and the world had taken on a faintly light green hue. You spent the whole evening watching the terrain for approaching apparitions or the return of the rider. Finally you slept, and you dreamt of home.",[149,4369,4370],{},"You dreamt of the partner you had left behind when you rode away. You dreamt of your family, and you dreamt of your brother. You were there at your fatherâs funeral again, and he was out on the veranda. They let you use the manor house to do your mourning, the owner of the farm was not cruel, though he was rarely overly kind.Â ",[149,4372,4373],{},"You saw your brother crying out there. Some part of you knew it wasnât just about your father. He carried some unfathomable weight that you could only scratch the surface of. Something you could never truly get your head around, though you tried to in the days that would follow the accident. You thought about going out there, talking to him. You didnât, and only you really know why. So many of your thoughts are unknown to me. When it comes down to it, would it have saved him? Would it have saved you?",[149,4375,222],{},[149,4377,4378],{},"You carried on for a week without much trouble. You managed to use some discretionary funds to buy a horse from a ranch you passed. Youâd still make good time for the commission bonus if you kept up at this speed. The weather had been pleasant enough, and you even got a bit of natural sunlight through breaks in the clouds.Â ",[149,4380,4381],{},"Some natural plantlife dotted the central south wastelands. You werenât far from the place from the Ancestral Glades from which much of the forest life of the continent once stemmed. It had been a comfortable break from the tumultuous start of the journey. No one knew, no one had followed you, and you wondered if the second encounter with that rider was even real. People saw things in the wastelands, too much isolation from life was bad for the mind.",[149,4383,4384],{},"Your new horse was white with a red mane and horns that curled like a ram. It lapped up water from a spring that would have been toxic for you, but was safe for its adjusted internal biology. You enjoyed another cigarette and lowered some of your cloth to get some sun on your skin. It burned your pallid flesh but it felt like being reunited with something missing.Â ",[149,4386,4387],{},"When you heard the engine your heart stopped for a second. Then, not just one engine, but several. A multitude even, cresting the hill from whence you came. You saw trucks, buggies, and bikes pass by until the cloud of ashen dust they kicked up was too thick to see anything clearly. You kept your hand close to your pistol out of well-learned caution, and maybe some paranoia. The convoy continued on without a care for you, but you felt a piercing gaze buried in the crowd.Â ",[149,4389,4390],{},"When it was clear, you wiped your eyes and you checked your things. The box was still on your horseâs back. That wretched box. The one that had made your life such a nightmare for over a week. You had thought about opening it, but magical seals would reveal your treachery and you knew that. The Church would have its retribution and you would die. Still, some part of you so desperately wanted to know what all this was for. Why not carry it by caravan? Air travel? One courier was nothing. You werenât even a real courier by professional standards, more of a delivery person.Â ",[149,4392,4393],{},"You shook your head of the thoughts and looked back to the road, now covered in tire tracks. There was something else in the road, too. Something large, in two pieces. You hesitantly walked over. Then you gasped and fell to your back. You scrambled away and peered over. It was a body, your body, but it couldnât be. The clothes, the height, the build, it was you. Except the head, which had been severed and replaced with a ceramic helmet. On its face a neon painted smile, sloppily scrawled like a kid would draw.Â ",[149,4395,4396],{},"Away from it a few feet was the real head. You walked closely toward it, checking the road and surrounding terrain for traps and watchers. You picked it up with the caution of someone handling a bomb. The face you saw was not yours, but it was close. The hair color, the eye color, all correct. The nose was slightly off, but the message was clear to you nonetheless. You dropped the head and screamed into your hands, trying to muffle it. You collapsed onto the ground and sobbed. Why this had to happen to you, you didnât know. You cursed the job, and considered just dropping the box. You knew this wasnât an option, not if you wanted to survive.Â ",[149,4398,4399],{},"Your only options were to move forward and deliver the crate, or die to them or to this unseen tormentor. You steeled yourself, and you searched the body. You found two things on it, a note, and a small glowing orange capsule. The note was written in wild scrawl, by someone with not much control over their hand. âYou should have burned me.â and a crude drawing of a heart alongside a barely legible skull.Â ",[149,4401,4402],{},"How could he have survived? You were so sure you had done the job. You cursed yourself for not burning him when you should have. It was a sin, the 12th sin in Church canon. You were not an avid practitioner of the faith but reverence for the dead went beyond religion. What if it had been you? You rationalized it, said it was a matter of time. You had been so sure a traveling burner would do the job for you. We like to explain our sins to ourselves in ways that make us out to be more noble than we ever really were. You were no different in this respect.",[149,4404,4405],{},"You took the capsule in hand and collected the two scattered pieces of the body, your body. You burned it, and it did not take long. The stench of flame searing flesh slithered its way into your rebreatherâs vents and stayed there long after the job was done. In mere minutes, the body turned to ash and this poor fool, killed as a pawn in some other game, was put to rest.Â ",[149,4407,4408],{},"You got on your horse and rode as fast as you could away from there.",[149,4410,222],{},[149,4412,4413],{},"You rode for almost a day straight before you found some caves you could convince yourself they were safe enough to take rest in. Another storm was coming and you thanked the gods for the shelter. You were another day from the nearest town.Â ",[149,4415,4416],{},"You saw the lights in the cave and that gave you some pause. You carefully peered inside, and you were fairly sure it wasnât the man you were looking for. Instead, you came inside and found me. I had been waiting for you, but I didnât tell you this. You brought your horse and things in and I greeted you pleasantly. The fire was roaring and I was sitting cross legged in its warmth.Â ",[149,4418,4419],{},"You were taken aback. Perhaps you didnât know what to make of me. After all, I donât wear the protective gear you did. I do not need to do these things to survive out here. I marveled at you. You looked exactly how you did in your mindâs eye, though maybe a little more ragged, and a little shorter.",[149,4421,4422],{},"I offered you a seat, and when you secured your horse you joined me. You had grown so wary by the time we met. You kept your hand near your gun at all times. Maybe you were always like this. I knew so many things about you, but I knew so much less than I wanted to. Even now, youâre a mystery Iâll never get to solve. This is okay, I do not need answers. I appreciated your company all the same.Â ",[149,4424,4425],{},"You regarded me carefully. Perhaps you recognized me but you couldnât figure out where from. It clicked when we introduced ourselves. You said your name, which had such a delightful ring to it. I said mine, and you knew me as âRidlek of Morwood.â You did not believe this was a real name, as St. Ridlek is a figure of legend for you. For me, it is just life. The only life I know.Â ",[149,4427,4428],{},"We talked. You asked me what I was doing out there, and I told you the truth. I was on pilgrimage to the Glades, and then I would continue on to the Veil that bordered the south. I asked you why you were out there, and you told me a lie. Something about going to see your family out in Sidersberg. I let you keep your secrets, we both quietly knew the truth.",[149,4430,4431],{},"I offered you some wine, and you said no at first. I took a swig and let its bitter, metallic taste fill me. I offered again, and this gesture of deference was enough to convince you to say yes. You took out your last two cigarettes and offered me one. We had a delightful evening drunk and high at the fire. You never asked what was in the wine that tasted so strange, and I never told you. It might have mattered, had things gone differently. They did not go differently, so it did not matter.Â ",[149,4433,4434],{},"When we were thoroughly intoxicated, I asked more about you. We talked about a lot of things. Life on the ash farm, life as a delivery person, the differences between delivery men and couriers in Astaelian parlance. You asked about me and I told you about life in Morwood, what itâs been like seeing the sights. You assumed I was lying. Maybe I was. Time, space, realityâ¦ All things I experienced differently from you. We would never have had enough time for me to explain the truths I knew and still know. It did not matter, this was not my story. It was yours.",[149,4436,4437],{},"We talked about your family, about your mother, father, and brother. You told me a bit, though not everything. You were glad to have a chance to speak about it. When the evening had grown long you admitted that you felt as though you were being hunted. That you had been turned into prey for some kind of predator that had decided to toy with you before making the kill. You did not tell me about shooting him, or about failing to burn him. You just said that you were worried. Worried that if you didnât figure out something you would be consumed.",[149,4439,4440],{},"I told you, plainly, that you had to finish the job.",[149,4442,4443],{},"When you woke up the fire had smoldered to embers, and I was gone. I left behind the flask of wine and another gift for you. So you knew I was real, and so you knew how to best handle your phantom.Â ",[149,4445,222],{},[149,4447,4448],{},"Another week passed and you traveled safely. More signs that you were being followed cropped up. Dead animals, notes, splatters of blood. You had grown desensitized to it. It invoked less a sense of terror, and more a grim inevitability. You would find him out there. My words carried with you, and you would finish the job.",[149,4450,4451],{},"You picked a place and began your work. At the farm, hordes of wild boar would occasionally try to make a run on your crops. Fighting them with conventional weapons was impractical. So you would set traps and feast on wild pork. The same principle as now. You would hunt the hunter, or you would die trying.",[149,4453,4454],{},"My gift you placed in pieces against the exterior wall of a rocky tunnel, carved into a cliff face to keep the road going. A handheld device connected to them all, though you set several cables of thin twine to set it off should that fail. You stood at the edge of the overpass, and made certain that the natural lay of the land made it impossible to circumvent without passing through this point. Your enemy did not know you were prepared.Â ",[149,4456,4457],{},"You waited, and kept waiting. So long passed that you began to wonder if he would even come at all. You knew he would, but he always seemed aware of your movements. Maybe he saw this trap coming?",[149,4459,4460],{},"When you were about to pack up and give up, you heard the familiar engine. The bike roared down the road right at you. You stood and held your hands up, a feint of surrender. By the time the man could see your smiling face, it was too late. You pressed the button and threw yourself to the ground as the blast shook everything.Â ",[149,4462,4463],{},"You blacked out briefly and your ears were ringing, but when you came to you saw the tunnel collapsed. You cheered. Though you realized now you had no means of burning the body. You had to burn the body, so you started trying to pull scorched stones off the pile. Maybe the body was destroyed in the blast? Would you be so lucky?Â ",[149,4465,4466],{},"You went back to your horse to grab a tool to dig through the rubble. You were met with another blast and a with a searing pain in your back and stomach. You gawked at the hole in your gut. You tried in vain, and through hideous pain, to put your intestines back in your body. You collapsed to the ground, the blow to your spine left you unable to walk. You spat up blood that filled your mask. You ripped it off and looked around in desperation for the source of your wound. At the edge of the tunnel there was a man, or a creature, half of one. Ichor pooled together into the body of a humanoid, you would not have identified it as the rider were it not for the hat and clothes had had been absorbed into its form.",[149,4468,4469],{},"It held a shotgun that smoked from the blast. It was not human, not any of the other species either. Youâd never seen anything like it. Beige twisted flesh sculpted itself into new life from some kind of liquid slime state. It held the gun with distended, unnatural arms that flared off into tentacles in every direction. Some kind of mutant? A lab subject? You never got to find out.Â ",[149,4471,4472],{},"You crawled toward the crate. Your blood stained the ground beneath you. Your head was light and your heartbeat irregular. You would not survive. You had to know what was in the crate. You had to know what this all was for. You pulled it down and unsealed it. The reassembled man- or rather creature- stood over you. It waited for you to open the box, and it trained the gun on you for a final shot.",[149,4474,4475],{},"Inside the box was the same sterile white. Secured in its center was some kind of book, face bound in ancient leather and marked in a language you couldnât begin to comprehend. Your head was light and your strength failed you. The rider kicked you over, away from the case.Â ",[149,4477,4478],{},"When you come face to face with a monster, it is natural to expect to see cruelty, malice, bloodlust. These things make sense to us. They are impulses that even someone who isnât a monster could feel, given the appropriate context. In this way, we expect monsters to be like us. We make them more human than we have any right to, because we are more comfortable with the things we know.Â ",[149,4480,4481],{},"When you looked into the riderâs gnarled, twisted face. You saw nothing. No hint of desire or want, no hatred for you. It was as empty as the void, and in your final moments that is what scared you the most. When it raised its shotgun and fired a blast that pulverized your skull, it did so without care. It simply did what it was supposed to, like a biological machine.Â ",[149,4483,4484],{},"It did not leave you there to rot. It burned you. Not because it cared about your immortal soul, nor had any sense of justice. It did so because whatever unseen masters that motivated it preferred no evidence of their intervention be left behind. When your body was totally gone, and your soul released, it simply picked up the package, took your horse, and rode away.",{"title":2305,"searchDepth":2306,"depth":2306,"links":4486},[4487],{"id":4147,"depth":2306,"text":4152,"children":4488},[4489],{"id":3427,"depth":3230,"text":139},"2023-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","A wasteland journey plagued by a pursuing revenant.

A long metal table was covered in papers and the empty bottle of Korvuni Blue we had brought back with us. The room was lined with other furniture.

Nonetheless, Iâm going to act like it's yoursâ first time.â",[149,6200,6201],{},"I started pacing âI am going to lay down three rules that you will obey if you want to stay alive.â I counted with exaggerated finger motions, â 1. When I tell you to do something, you do it. There will be no discussion, no debate. Obey me. 2. If you see something coming at you that isnât one of the four people here, you shoot. Corporate soldiers, Imperials, marauders, wildlife, the fucking Helping Hands Brigade, open fire. 3. If we come across a ruin, do not touch *anything*. No matter what you think itâs worth. If it looks like a good haul, tell me. Iâll look at it, and Iâll even let you keep it. Thatâs how nice I am. IF at any point there is somehow a conflict between Rules 1, 2, and 3, prioritize Rule 1.â",[149,6203,6204],{},"I spun around to face them, âAny questions?â",[149,6206,6207],{},"Nobody said anything.

The voices outside were still talking. Too far and too metallic to make out details. It sounded like bursts of radio static in conversation with each other. Three? Yeah, three voices. I stuck my head out very slightly. Nice armor, armed well, and a mounted turret on their truck. Corporate for sure, couldnât make out which one. No way we were taking them. I tapped the worn wall with my metal fist. This wasnât going to hold up against turret fire.Â ",[149,6217,6218],{},"So the next question, what do we do? We could have left out the back and hoped they didnât see us. Too much open land, and not enough concealing terrain. Taking them out already wasnât an option. That left wait, but that depended heavily on what they were doing out here. If they were just passing by, why stop here? If they were a patrol, they were probably going to check this structure. So, how thoroughly?",[149,6220,6221],{},"I looked at the rest of the tower structure above us. Early Parathan Imperial as best as I could figure. The solid granite building would give way to blends of basalt and decorative marble later in their reign. There were two more floors, partially exposed by a collapse in the structure. I wouldnât trust the top floor but the middle floor didnât look too bad. The stairs went in the collapse, so weâd have to get creative. I made a mental path of things weâd have to climb to get up there. Quietly, if the gods were kindâ¦",[149,6223,6224],{},"One of the metal voices was getting closer. My choice was made for me.Â ",[149,6226,6227],{},"I motioned the others to follow and made my way from a pile of ancient, hardened sacks of grain. Next, I grabbed a rusted wall sconce and used it to swing up to the protruding lip of a column. Then I leveraged myself into an alcove in the wall, and from there I could reach the second floor. I grabbed it, solid enough on this side. Praise the gods. I wriggled my way up and started helping the others following the same path. Arina was almost too short to make the last jump, Temperance and I had to help her up.Â ",[149,6229,6230],{},"We got up just as the patrolman reached the threshold.

I tried to quiet my breathing, which was amplified through the mask.Â ",[149,6232,6233],{},"We heard him talking, clearly now, âYeah I heard it too. Sounded like something running around in here. Praise.â There was a quiet that followed, I heard each heavy step of his boots. He got closer to the edge of our floor. Arina was sticking too close, I pulled her back by her legs.Â ",[149,6235,6236],{},"âDonât see anything. Same empty tower. Orders? Praise.âÂ ",[149,6238,6239],{},"There was some second end of the conversation we couldnât hear.Â ",[149,6241,6242],{},"âYeah, probably vermin. Iâm headed back. Praise be.â The boots began stepping away, then past the threshold. Temperance started to stand up, and I whacked them on the back. I made a down motion with my hands. We werenât clear yet. I waited until the truckâs combustion engine came to life, and drove away.Â ",[149,6244,6245],{},"I peeked my head out of the window on our floor. âClear.â Sighs of relief all around. Everyone started standing up. âCareful, I donât know how much I trust this level.â I tapped the ground with my foot and a stone brick shifted. âActually, I donât trust it.âÂ ",[149,6247,6248],{},"Dorian stepped off first, with no regard for the drop. He landed like a cat. Fall augmentation? Arina and Temperance went down with a little more caution. I checked around for any unscavenged swag. No use. This place had been picked dry centuries ago. I went down next. It was getting dark outside. I considered making camp here. We were about half a day away from our destination, and weâd have to use lanterns to go much further right now. Too visible.",[149,6250,6251],{},"Scavvers had rules against spending too much time in Parathan ruins. I wasnât particularly superstitious. I didnât think the demise of the Parathan Empire was some curse by the gods or anything. At least no more a curse than that inflicted on the rest of the mortals of Vian. There were moreâ¦ Wait. Something in Dorianâs hand. Something small, metal, pipe-shaped. It didnât come in with us.Â ",[149,6253,6254],{},"I rushed over, âWhat do you have?â He looked up and down at the object in his hand. He tried to put it away. I asked again, nearly screaming. âWhat do you have?â",[149,6256,6257],{},"I forcefully grabbed his hand and pried it open. I shrieked when I saw it. A brass rod engraved with runes that were faintly illuminated blue. I grabbed it with my metal hand and ran outside. Dorian roared after me. âWHAT THE FUCK?âÂ ",[149,6259,6260],{},"The rod began to emanate a high-pitched whine. âRULE 3!â I shouted back.Â ",[149,6262,6263],{},"I threw the rod as far as I could away from the tower. It detonated in a huge red flash.",[149,6265,6266],{},"I felt firm hands pull me back and spin me around. Dorian was screaming at me. âYOU FUCKING IDIOT! I FOUND IT! IT WAS ENCHANTED!â He punched me, aiming for my nose and instead jamming my mask deep into my face. I stumbled, confirmed nothing was broken, then I pushed him back. We struggled, I hadnât realized how much I wanted a chance to knock sense into this prissy idiot. I got him in a headlock for a second, he drove an elbow into my gut. Temperance pulled him back. I went in for a punch but Arina charged into my abdomen, trying with all her might to hold me there.",[149,6268,6269],{},"The anger fizzled, and I looked back at Dorian.

There was something so beautiful about trees standing so resolute, centuries after they had died. I broke a branch off of one that fell and used it as a walking stick. I looked around. As I suspected, the patrols seemed to stay closer to the estate.Â ",[149,6396,6397],{},"In the ravine was a sealed grate, sure enough. I stopped the other two.

The solution hissed and bubbled, and it was like watching centuries of wear and tear happen in real-time. Strong metal turned to rust, and Temperance gave it a good yank. It ripped a hole into it. The displaced bars rattled on the dusty ground. All of us could fit inside. They beamed, âI thought about putting âdoor-making specialistâ on business cards once.â They gave the âafter youâ gesture with their arms.

Our clothes and environmental gear would need triple sanitation when we were done.Â ",[149,6411,6412],{},"I followed Birdieâs map faithfully. These underworks were shared by a few local installations.

The whole place was surprisingly bright. Sterile white light panels had been installed at the base of the wall, and more hung from the metal framework of the glass roof. We were behind a shed. I peeked around the side. A lush green meditation garden, marked with a spiral pattern of stones toward the center. Birdieâs interior map was accurate. I would have to ask her how she sourced it. Temperance peeked out from behind me. âRather pretty,â they observed.Â ",[149,6472,6473],{},"I ducked back behind the shed. âArtificial.

Close to the villa itself now.",[149,6484,6485],{},"One sentry between us and the front door. We could go around back but that would be close to where Dorian was distracting the security chief.

He didnât seem to mind.",[149,6507,6508],{},"They made it to the grand natural birchwood double doors. Alice grabbed a doorknob and stared at the metalwork. It looked like Restoration Age craftsmanship. Rich bastard. Vulture tried it. Unlocked. Dumb bastard. It opened inward. She looked inside for any immediate sentries. She made a motion to Temperance and Arina, and let go of the priestâs arm.",[149,6510,6511],{},"It was an open floorplan, very modern. Contrasted by centuries-old decor. Paintings of nobles, and a couple of landscapes. Even some Parathan era swag, like a grand blue vase that had been apparently reassembled with bronze.Â  Temperance looked at Vulture, and saw in her eyes the hungry look of a scavver who was staring at one of the biggest hauls of her life. Then a shake of the head and her focus was back on the job. Temperance appreciated Vulture more than other would-be crew leaders. She had good priorities. This was too clean to risk with extra loot. That was the safe play. Though, maybe if the team got some extra timeâ¦",[149,6513,222],{},[149,6515,6516],{},"I made my way toward the far end of the room, where the sole occupant was dusting some shelves. The custodian had his back to me. It was as if the gods had ordained this run.Â  I kept low, to avoid being seen through the wide windows. Temperance held back and Arina was messing with the tablet. I closed the distance quickly. I opened my arms to grab him.Â ",[149,6518,6519],{},"He started turning around.Â ",[149,6521,6522],{},"Fuck. Impulse took over, I swung my metal arm in a punch. It connected with his skull and he tumbled back into the wall. He slumped, and blood started to trickle down the side of his head.Â ",[149,6524,6525],{},"The other two ran up. âHoly shit,â Temperance said, mirroring my thoughts. I held out my hand to Arina, âThe mirror you have. Now.â She passed it. Temperance held up his head. I held it under his nose. Still breathing. That was going to need some treatment though. At least-",[149,6527,6528],{},"A rifleâs hammer clicked.Â ",[149,6530,6531],{},"I looked over my shoulder. Arina was holding a gun to a woman in a nightgown. Our intel said his wife was supposed to be in Sidersberg. His wife who was a humanâ¦ This is an elekâ¦ younger tooâ¦ Ah. I stepped forward and tried to reassure her. She shriveled at the sight of blood on my hands. âPlease donât scream.â An empty appeal to a foregone conclusion. She let out a piercing wail.Â ",[149,6533,6534],{},"The gun fired and the woman went to the ground in a seizure. A fake bullet stuck to her and sent an electrical burst through her. Sheâd live but itâd hurt for a while. I nodded to Arina who had a look in her eyes that indicated that was her first time doing that. I tapped her on the shoulder and led us up the stairs. I heard shouts, followed by alarms. The bad outcome. I loaded a stun bolt.Â Â ",[149,6536,6537],{},"Up the stairs. One door guard, armored. He raised a gun. I raised my wrist and ducked. I fired just a second before him. The bolt struck him in the chest and the rifleâs shot went wide. He started convulsing on the ground, but would probably be fine. Probably. I checked behind me. The others had gone to ground. I smirked. We might be able to take this. I tapped my communicator. âD, how are you holding up out there? Praise.âÂ ",[149,6539,6540],{},"No answer.",[149,6542,6543],{},"With worry, âD?âÂ ",[149,6545,6546],{},"Static.",[149,6548,6549],{},"I looked to the others, who were looking down the stairwell. Arina called out âI count at least 3 more. They sound heavy.â I started eyeing the hallway we were in. I tried the door to KanraâLasâ room. Locked, figures. I tried the others. No luck. I eyed the available furniture for cover. A few tables. Antique wood, but nothing thatâd take a bullet.Â ",[149,6551,6552],{},"âT, got a smoke grenade?âÂ ",[149,6554,6555],{},"They looked at me like I said something dumb. Then reached into their bag and grabbed a canister. Activated it, and threw it into the center of the room. A plume of red-grey smoke began to fill the hallway. Perfect. These two werenât soldiers but I figured we had a fighting chance. I stepped back and loaded another bolt. Lethal this time. Pistol in my other hand. Letâs go.Â ",[149,6557,6558],{},"I heard a click behind me and the opening of the door behind me. I spun around. The deafening bang of a gunshot. I felt a deep heat in my abdomen. Blood soaked the clothes around my gut. An elek standing with a pistol in his shaky hands. Blonde hair, balding. KanraâLas. The pain caught up to me. I crumpled to the ground.Â ",[149,6560,6561],{},"Temperance screamed and rushed towards me. I couldnât think or see straight. It was like I was viewing the events through a few layers of removal. There was an Alice on the ground, bleeding out, but I was watching her from way high up. From the sky. Maybe from the void. I tried to remember the advice I had been given for this back in the service. My mind was too cloudy. From my aerial view, I saw guards swarming our position. Then I saw nothing.",[149,6563,222],{},[149,6565,6566],{},"Ice-cold water splashed my face. For a moment it was like I was drowning. I thrashed weakly, like a caught fish. âHeâs alive.â some distant voice said Then I felt someone grab my jaw and pull my mouth open. More water went down my gullet.Â  Some instinct took over in me and I drank it greedily. There was so much pain in my abdomen. I had never understood why people wanted water when they were dying, but it made more sense now.Â ",[149,6568,6569],{},"My vision returned to me. The two armed men who had been dousing me with a bucket of water left the cell. The cell. I looked around, my vision blurry. Pain too serious to think. The others were there. Or at least so I thought. Temperance ran up to me. Arina stood over. I saw Dorian in the corner of the large dark holding cell, arms folded. âWhereâ¦ were you?â I spat out blood and groaned in pain.Â ",[149,6571,6572],{},"âI was hiding. Key, *was.* Until someone started blowing up my radio and gave me away.â",[149,6574,6575],{},"Some twinge of regret, muted by the agony. âS-so-sor-â I was shaking.Â ",[149,6577,6578],{},"Temperance shot their head back âThis isnât the time. Sheâs hurt.â They looked at me. âHealing potions donât work on you, right? They tried to apply Formula Y and it just wouldnât take.â",[149,6580,6581],{},"I nodded. I thought about dying. About my soul. I wondered how soon Iâd get to see the beautiful land they said the gods took us to. I looked at the priest, âYouâll burn meâ¦â",[149,6583,6584],{},"Temperance shook their head. âNo, I wonât. I donât burn the living. Youâre not dead yet girl, come on. Stay with me.â",[149,6586,6587],{},"âCanât you just magic it or something? Youâre a priest right?â Dorian was sitting and sulking now.Â ",[149,6589,6590],{},"Arina agreed, âYeah you could! You showed us that cool cloak technique out there!â",[149,6592,6593],{},"Temperance frowned. âHealing magic is difficult even for a full-fledged mage. The Lady of Magick doesnât like us messing with the forms of others.â They paused, âI can try. Arina, keep her awake and alive. Dorian, just brood, I guess.â",[149,6595,6596],{},"The young elek ran up. âWhat do I do? What do I say?â She looked terrified. I imagined what I looked like from her point of view, pallid and dying.",[149,6598,6599],{},"âJust ask her questions.â Temperance was chanting something to themself and wringing their hands together.",[149,6601,6602],{},"âOkayâ¦ Hey Vulture. Itâs Arina! Youâre going to be okay. Just focus on my voice. Look in my eyes. My mom says she likes my eyesâ¦ Sorry, Iâm nervous.âÂ ",[149,6604,6605],{},"âItâs okay... Theyâreâ¦ a good shade of gold.â I offered. I was having trouble staying conscious. Maybe I could just sleep.Â ",[149,6607,6608],{},"Temperance smacked my face firmly a couple of times. âHey, no sleeping. Arina, keep her awake at all costs.â",[149,6610,6611],{},"Arina jumped and ran up and repeated the face-smacking motion, though hesitantly.

I knew I had said something I wasnât meant to. It didnât matter. I gnashed my teeth as Temperance put their hands in my wound. After a second they pulled back and tossed a piece of metal to the side. âThe bullet is out.â They poured some of the water bucket on it. Then put their hands back on my wound. A strange warmth filled my side.Â ",[149,6625,6626],{},"âOkayâ¦ Alice Mercier-Durante. Where are you from?â",[149,6628,6629],{},"âMy family is from Salianaâ¦ I grew up in New Bektonâ¦ s-since I was f-f-four.â I was shivering.Â ",[149,6631,6632],{},"âThatâs a long way to go.

Big fan of Natasha Irinde beforeâ¦â Her turn towards Imperial sympathy was well known.",[149,6667,6668],{},"âYeah, I was too.â Arina consoled.Â ",[149,6670,6671],{},"The pain was still present, but lessened and dull. Like being poked with the blunt edge of a pen. I looked down, and it had been replaced with a bulging mound of flesh. Temperance looked up at me. âIt should be safe. Itâll probably leave a scar. I am not a professional healer.â",[149,6673,6674],{},"I smiled weakly, âThanks.â",[149,6676,6677],{},"They stood up and went to take a seat on another bench, panting to catch their breath. My bench, I realized, was covered in blood.Â ",[149,6679,6680],{},"Arina did the same. Then she started sobbing, which triggered a look of disgust from Dorian.Â ",[149,6682,6683],{},"We stayed there in that scene for a while. I rested my head against the wall.Â  Dorian glared at Arinaâs sobbing, and eventually, Temperance went over to console them.

You lost a lot of blood.â",[149,6688,6689],{},"Arina stopped crying, going to that sniffling phase that often followed.

Thatâs someone who never has to worry where their next meal is coming from.â",[149,6711,6712],{},"âNot what this is about, but okay. Sure. I come from money. We even have a big stake in STARCAST. Thatâs why Iâm here. What about you Ms. Mercier-Durante? I had you pegged for some poor first-generation immigrant, but I know your family. Made a huge fortune on the terraforming projects out east. Youâre telling me thatâs not money?â",[149,6714,6715],{},"I regretted my mindless confession. âI donât take a dime from them.â",[149,6717,6718],{},"âAnd I donât take a dime from mine!

Maybe we call the guards, and say Iâm dying.. They donât know Iâm healed. Or-âÂ  I became acutely aware that none of them were paying attention to me. Something was behind me.",[149,6777,6778],{},"I turned around and faced a purple drone with white spots floating at eye level.Â  Dotty. It adjusted its resograph lens to look at me. âHuh.â",[149,6780,6781],{},"We all looked at Arina, who held up her small hands. âNot me, they took my slate.â",[149,6783,6784],{},"I turned around again.

I thanked the drone and Arina and Temperance did too. Dotty, and presumably Birdie, gave an affirmative bounce. I peeked my head out into the hallway. One led to another cell. These cells were decently sized. Why did this place have the capacity to hold like 20 people? I shook the thought from my mind. The other way must lead out. I beckoned for the others to follow.",[149,6789,6790],{},"We stayed low and quiet. There was a resograph above us but it seemed powered off. Another gift from Birdie? The hallway turned. This building wasnât big, we had to be nearing an office. I popped my head around the corner. Yeah, an office. Two guards in there. They were armed and armored, and we werenât either. Though we had numbers. I looked at Dotty, not a combat model. I tried to think. What would we do in the service?",[149,6792,6793],{},"Shock and awe.Â ",[149,6795,6796],{},"I explained my plan through a series of complex gestures and whispers.

The knife was still there. Merciful gods.",[149,6798,6799],{},"I started to move forward. Once I was sure they didnât notice us I stood up.

Their arm flailed for their pistol, which I wrenched out of their hand.",[149,6804,6805],{},"I didnât think. I just stood back, disengaged the safety, and fired twice in the chest. Blood spattered on the chair, the wall, and the floor, and merged with some of my own on my clothes. Temperance, Arina, and Dorian were beating the shit out of the other one. They turned her in her swivel chair toward me. I gave her one shot to the head.",[149,6807,6808],{},"With both guards in the station dead, we collected ourselves. I tried to clear my mind of what just happened, and my eyes scanned the office. 6 guards in the facility, 6 desks. I looked at the primas-ika, with a special badge on their chest. Security chief. I figured the dead lady was the second in command. Goodâ¦ good. I saw a row of lockers and footlockers. Several bags of items were placed on the ground. Our gear.Â ",[149,6810,6811],{},"We rushed over and reclaimed our things. Dotty was inert, whatever remote control was exerted over it having been released. How Birdie pulled this off at such a range was beyond me. Arina grabbed her slate and regained control of it. Temperance began the rites of the dead for the slain security officers. The stench of burning flesh filled the room and set off the smoke alarms. I opened a locker left open by someone careless.

Bullets started flying into our shield wall as soon as we were in sight. Three of them, behind deployable cover, in sealed armor. We settled in our position and crouched. Temperance threw a glass sphere over our heads. It landed in the middle of their defenses in a whoosh of flame. One of them caught fire and started howling. Shields down, we opened fire. Two of them went down easily. Bullets across their torsos. The third got a shot off and I heard Dorian exclaim. Arina retaliated with a shot to their neck. They went down suffocating.Â ",[149,6943,6944],{},"6 guards down. That should be them all.
