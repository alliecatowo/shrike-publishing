A woman with horns like a ram was singing and playing a guitar, accompanied by backing music from a soundboard. It was upbeat, folksy, and reminded him of the sort of music his kids would like. Many of the patrons ignored the music, but a decent crowd had gathered around her. Her melody carried to the rest over an internal sound system. The bar goers were a mix of locals and travelers of all different shapes and sizes.",[152,429,430],{},"No one paid Torinn any mind as he made his way through the central room.

You all are incorrigible!\" She tuned the instrument. \"I've got one more for you all. It's a favorite for true Astaelians! About a cowardly nobleman who abandoned his city. A man by the name of Lord Varan.\"",[152,435,436],{},"Torinn's heart sank deep in the recesses of his chest. He knew what song she meant. The crowd was ecstatic.

Then it seemed as if she realized the elek's will matched- if not outmatched- her own. She turned away and motioned to her men. \"Let's go, boys. This is a fuckin' waste of time,\" she half-muttered. They made a half-hearted gesture at turning with her. Neither Torinn nor Gallin'Vir were fooled.

Even for the fraction of a second that it was, it was more than enough time. Decades of instinct took over in Torinn. He pushed Gallin'Vir to the ground, drew his revolver and rushed the jackal. Reaching out, he pushed the rifle out of their hands, then sidestepped while putting them to his front.",[152,587,588],{},"The big one raised his weapon and fired before he could even realize what he was doing. The jackal's chest took the brunt of the impact, sending them tumbling back into Torinn. With it came a sudden burning pain in Torinn's side.

He gritted his teeth and clutched his right hip. He pushed the now dead jackal off of him and looked to the fresh wound. The shotgun grazed his hip â shallow wounds, but bloody.

No trouble would follow.",[152,647,648],{},"Settled in their private car, Torinn gnashed his teeth as the last scattershot pellet was removed from his side. It was a flesh wound, but no amount of getting shot was ever really acceptable. Gallin'Vir opened up his bag, revealing vials, bottles, and composite flasks that each glowed and glittered different colors. Torinn knew these were tools of a trade, but they seemed wondrous all the same.

He worked fast, wiping down and cleaning the wound expertly.",[152,653,654],{},"Gallin'Vir uncorked the glass vial. \"This will sting,\" he cautioned, though Torinn knew how this went. A couple of drops fell onto his wound, and the alchemist massaged them into the torn skin. Torinn bit his forearm to keep from crying out. Instead, he let out a low, pained grunt as the flesh began to stitch itself back together. Within half a minute, the wound was closed. All that remained was a bulging bit of irritated flesh. \"Looks to be healing well. Don't pick at it, and it will be gone within the hour.\"",[152,656,657],{},"Torinn nodded and thanked his healer. Yender's Formula was a marvel, but uncomfortable. One's flesh and muscle repairing itself at that speed blended the sensation of burning and electrical tingling.

He still had a bit of trouble moving his left shoulder after a botched application in the war.",[152,659,660],{},"The alchemist made eye contact with him.

He grabbed his brown button-up from the floor, noting the damage. He'd see about getting it patched up.

He folded it, stuffed it in the bag, and put on a simple black tee he kept for emergencies.",[152,671,672],{},"He sat back down and looked out the window. A destroyed landscape sped by. The wasteland was a vast stretch of ash and jagged rock formations that carried on into the Alura Desert out west. Further out from that was the foot of the Kavan mountain range. If one looked closely in the moonlight, they could see it dotted with mutated plant life, ruins of civilizations before, and small settlements. Then the nagging memory manifested in the words and song of the bar musician. Somewhere out there, beyond view, was a hole in the world. What remained of Varanskeep, his home.",[152,674,675],{},"He kept staring, and the mechanical rhythm of the train's motion lulled him into a sort of trance.

It was metal, with a prominent dent in the side. He reached into the container and pulled out a round, snub tube made of brass and glass. At one end of its structure, Torinn noticed a small switch.

He shifted his question. \"Is it alright?\"",[152,683,684],{},"Gallin'Vir stopped mumbling, and his head darted up. After a second to process, he nodded, \"Yes, yes. The container absorbed the impact. No fuel, as expected. No reason to think this would be volatile. \" He went back to looking down and took out a small black rectangle of metal and glass. He thumbed a button on the side and began tapping on its surface. The dataslate was Gallin'Vir's preferred notebook.",[152,686,687],{},"Torinn let out a long sigh and grabbed a flask filled with brandy from his bag.

He knew how lucky he was, compared to many others, especially among the pre-Empire nobility. Gallin'Vir was doing important work, even if few other people realized it. Torinn's family had heavily instilled the virtues of history. Even past superstition, he saw the value. The Parathan had nearly conquered the world. So much was accomplished. Their advances in the science of alchemy had built the modern world, without doubt.",[152,695,696],{},"Of course, all empires fall, and the Parathan fell spectacularly. \"The Judgement\" came.

Good time, all things considered. The platform crowded with tired people as they shambled out of the cozy train into the bitter air of the night.

He assured Torinn they'd meet in time for their departure.

The parent cried out and went to pull open their bag, perhaps a little too quickly. They were struck in the face with the butt of a rifle. Another soldier fired into the air and held the gun to the kid's head. The instincts of the other travelers had taken over.

The same could be said of most arcane and alchemical technologies. Still, that didn't ease his mind when the large, tubular locomotive came roaring into the station.

Outside of the main cars were reinforced, rounded alloy plates that each had \"GT FLASHTRACK\" painted on its hull.",[152,856,857],{},"He looked over to Gallin'Vir, who was staring at the porters loading their luggage. He frowned and stood on the tips of his toes. The flashtrack's setup didn't allow for personal luggage to be carried with the passengers. Torinn set his hand on the smaller man's shoulder. Neither of them said anything. He wasn't the best comfort. Gallin'Vir thanked him with a slight smile anyway.",[152,859,860],{},"Torinn watched as the previous passengers of the train filed out, waiting for their turn to board with similar anticipation to a man awaiting execution. Soon enough, they made their way in. The inside of their car was dark. No windows, per safety regulation.

In the stead of individual seats were metal benches with two harnesses and headrests attached to each side.",[152,862,863],{},"Torinn worked on his harness. It made a tight 'X' across his torso. He felt like a trapped animal. He didn't want to be here. Every noise was amplified, the chatter of passengers situated, the clicking of security belts, the slow, burdened clunkâ¦ clunkâ¦ clunkâ¦ of the porters' magboots as they made their way up and down the car checking tickets. It was all deafening.",[152,865,866],{},"He closed his eyes and sighed. When he got anxious he pictured his wife, Salee. Her blonde hair with tasteful streaks of grey, swept into a ponytail. Her kind green eyes. How she'd hold his hand a little tighter than he would expect of hands so fine. How she'd say, \"It's all okay. This will pass.\" He lingered there in the moment, then he felt a sharp prick in his right hand, followed by a rushing coolness into his veins.",[152,868,869],{},"Torinn yelped and opened his eyes in surprise, he looked down to see the syringe that Gallin'Vir had jammed into his hand. He met the elek's orb-like eyes, \"Just a mild sedative,\" he said, with a casualness that suggested drugging someone was the most normal thing in the world. Torinn didn't know whether to be furious or grateful. The sedative kicked in and decided for him. His muscles relaxed and he placed his head back on the rest. Nothing left to do but enjoy the ride.",[152,871,872],{},"A distant call came from outside, and the automatic doors shut. Within five minutes the train was in motion. Departure was slow and normal at first, despite what the accommodations within would suggest. That changed twenty minutes into the trip. A klaxxon buzzed twice, and the flashtrack lurched, throwing the occupants back in their seats. A humming started, slow and almost impossible to perceive above the background noise of the train's motion. Then it turned to a buzzing, and the air took on a blueish hue. A faint stench like hair burning in the distance assaulted his nose..",[152,874,875],{},"From behind he heard a porter walking.

He flew above the icy peak of Haigspir, the tallest mountain in the world. The same place where the Council of The Gods had gathered their first followers, ten souls to spread their influence across the world. The Prophets, who would build their namesake hall on that peak.

She was neither, but she wouldn't be long. She set down a duffel bag on an impressively cleaned floor, grabbed the stool they kept for people her height, and washed her hands. She still felt some sticky residue from lunch.",[152,1163,1164],{},"In the mirror she saw tanned skin and golden, iris-less eyes. Her shoulder-length jet black hair matched her eyeshadow. Long, rounded ears were adorned with piercings of different metals and colors. Her lip had a prominent scar that she'd gotten on one of her first jobs. Her parents had wanted her to get it fixed, but she thought it made her look badass.",[152,1166,1167],{},"She realized how long she had been standing there admiring herself. She hopped down, kicked the stool to the side, and opened the bag. First, she took out a plated vest and worked it on. Next, an olive green jumpsuit with a name on the breast that wasn't hers, Lani'Qera. It fit easily over her other clothes and the armor.",[152,1169,1170],{},"She took a syringe out of the bag, and unfolded a piece of paper from her pocket. Drawn on it was a realistic depiction of a face. Another elek, presumably Lani'Qera. She made some adjustments, extended the needle and took a breath, jamming the needle repeatedly into her head. Cheek, jaw, lips, eyes, nose.",[152,1172,1173],{},"The pain was excruciating, but worse were the effects after. Her face burned like she had lit it on fire, and pains shot down her neck and into spine. She tasted blood and her vision had gone white. When it passed, she looked in the mirror. No longer did she see her own face, but the face on the paper. She moved her jaw and made a couple expressions until her mind registered that this new visage was hers. She burned the paper with a lighter from her pocket, grabbed a dataslate, and closed the bag.",[152,1175,1176],{},"Back out in the plaza she made quick time toward her next destination. She kept her eyes on the slate, occasionally glancing around. It was powered off, but she found people were less likely to bother someone who looked like they were working.",[152,1178,1179],{},"A fifteen minute walk in and she saw an avian, a Yasre, in a jumpsuit like hers admiring some religious necklaces in a display window. She didn't know the face, but she had a guess who it was. \"That you under all that?\" An odd statement if she was wrong, but she wasn't.",[152,1181,1182],{},"The person turned their head toward her. Long yellowed tusks, artificially lengthened dark feathers in a mane around their head, and a snub nose. They replied in a thick Psreidish accent.

I think I look pretty cute right now! \" She twirled. \"You're okay too. \" She meant it, though she lamented they couldn't have picked a face to steal that was a little cleaner. Smaller tusks.",[152,1199,1200],{},"They mutually nodded, and both began to make their way to the employee-only area Arina stage-whispered about a fake schedule for the day. Soon enough, they found the access hallway they were looking for. Behind the grandeur of the customer areas, these hallways were already showing signs of age. The Voidspire had only opened a few years ago, but its construction had taken a century. Arina wondered how long workers had been treading these halls.",[152,1202,1203],{},"Custodians and maintenance workers passed by. They nodded at them and they nodded back. Arina wondered if she would even have been noticed with her own face.",[152,1205,1206],{},"They both looked around. The hallway was filled with metal doors: offices, it seemed. A custodial closet, too. At one end of the hall was the entrance they had come in from, at the other was a fork. A sign at the forking paths indicated that going left would take them to the maintenance elevators. They took that path, skirting past two workers having a debate about the professional duelist season.",[152,1208,1209],{},"A couple of turns later, and they found themselves at the elevators.

They only went part of the way up, not cleared for breaking orbit, but as far as the duo needed.",[152,1211,1212],{},"Next to each of the three elevators was a small panel with a hole the size of a finger. A blood-lock, keyed to only those who had access. \"You got this? \" Arina glanced at Temperance.",[152,1214,1215],{},"The Yasre nodded and murmured something to themself. \"You're on watch. \" They had their own bag that clinked much more when they set it down. They pulled out some tools and began to work on the security.",[152,1217,1218],{},"Arina stood in front of the bird person, trying to make her small frame as concealing as possible.

The machine lifted her off the ground and she felt her jumpsuit ripping. This thing had to be twice her height. She found the power button, praise the gods.

Electricity coursed through the baton and through the machine.",[152,1277,1278],{},"It dropped her, and she took the fall into a roll. She paused for a second and focused. Both the machine and Temperance slowed considerably, or rather, she sped up.",[152,1280,1281],{},"The disruption was temporary, and the construct backstepped, trying to kick her with its weighted feet.

It landed in the concrete wall, leaving a distressingly deep hole.",[152,1286,1287],{},"No more time to decide, she let her gut take over.

The fungus was intact, though the machinery was probably damaged beyond repair. It would be able to find new life in a new exoskeleton. She tried to calm her breathing and wiped some sweat from her forehead.",[152,1295,1296],{},"She looked up and realized Temperance had been saying \"Come on!\" for half a minute. Down the hall, chaotic shouts as others came to investigate the commotion.",[152,1298,1299],{},"She grabbed her things and slid into the elevator car.

Midtown was her favorite, so much to do. Of course, Lowtown where most of the people lived. Millions upon millions, a truly amazing city.",[152,1328,1329],{},"Of course, nothing was more impressive than the tower they were climbing.

It was wall to wall with shelves, tables, and devices, each lined with experimental brews, different ingredients, and contraptions. Some chemical, some mechanical, some arcane.

The machine lifted her off the ground, and she felt her jumpsuit ripping. This thing had to be twice her height. She found the power button, praise the gods.

A titanic round glass window was built into the outer wall, bringing in the natural sunset onto what seemed to be a place full of plant life, surrounded by stone grey flooring and walls.

Reminded her of a nightclub she liked in Lowtown.",[152,2799,2800],{},"Temperance pointed them left, towards the hallway marked âHabitationâ.

There was a desk, a bed, a kitchen, a bathroom, and windows that revealed the purples and oranges of the last glow of day. In the center of it all, in a couch setup in a shallow pit in the floor, was an elek. The person, presumably TheoâVir, was in very fine lounge clothes.",[152,2833,2834],{},"The occupant spoke first.

Ritual must be observedâ¦â They paused their sentence to finish the prayer and add an amen. When they concluded, they produced a glowing orange capsule. The commotion was getting closer. Another prayer, and the capsule was broken open on TheoâVirâs body. The body burst into flames that wondrously didnât spread to the bed. The smell of a burnt corpse was strong even through their masks. In another life, well before Arina had known them, Temperance had been a priest of Death. Burners, they were often called. They still held their old practices in reverence.",[152,2876,2877],{},"Ritual observed and the spirit of the dead released, Temperance made quick strides to the windowed wall on bouncing avian legs.

She didnât even know there were still people who felt like *that.* She signed up to grab a book. Sheâd killed before, but no one had said this was a hit job.",[152,2879,2880],{},"Temperance took cover behind the couches, she did too.

Sounds rad anyway.â She tried to convince herself that things that scared her were cool. She held out her hand to spray, but first they handed her a pill. âYou wonât be able to breathe. This will help.â",[152,2900,2901],{},"She took the pill with apprehension, but she trusted her partner, her comrade. What other assurances did they have, if not each other? They embraced once more, and then Temperance began to apply the spray. It covered her person and began hardening like a stone. She couldnât see it, but it expanded around her into a rough egg-shaped pod. The Yasre was right, she couldnât breathe, but she didnât need to. It was freaky. Temperance said something she couldnât hear, and the sensation of gravity took her down to the surface.",{"title":239,"searchDepth":240,"depth":240,"links":2903},[],"2025-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","A high-action preview of the forthcoming novel Era of Silence: The Pit of Heaven.","/images/stories/banner.png",{},"/stories/thevoidspirejob",{"title":2441,"description":2905},"thevoidspirejob","stories/thevoidspirejob",[],"Cal_w2YYfVq4wPGoMwpE8zWn47Zd0w1SI8FKOs3sdkU",{"id":2915,"title":2916,"author":267,"body":2917,"date":3289,"description":3290,"extension":249,"image":3291,"meta":3292,"navigation":11,"path":3293,"price":2432,"published":11,"seo":3294,"slug":3295,"stem":3296,"tags":3297,"thumbnail":2432,"type":2437,"__hash__":3298},"stories/stories/vultures-city.md","Era of Silence- Vulture's City",{"type":140,"value":2918,"toc":3287},[2919,2922,2925,2928,2934,2937,2940,2943,2946,2948,2951,2954,2957,2960,2963,2966,2969,2972,2975,2978,2981,2984,2987,2990,2993,2996,2999,3002,3005,3008,3011,3014,3017,3020,3023,3026,3028,3031,3034,3037,3040,3043,3046,3049,3052,3055,3058,3061,3064,3067,3070,3073,3076,3079,3082,3085,3088,3091,3094,3097,3100,3103,3106,3109,3112,3115,3118,3121,3124,3127,3130,3133,3136,3139,3142,3145,3148,3151,3154,3157,3160,3163,3166,3169,3172,3175,3178,3181,3184,3187,3190,3192,3195,3198,3201,3204,3207,3210,3213,3216,3219,3222,3225,3228,3231,3234,3237,3240,3243,3246,3249,3252,3254,3257,3260,3263,3266,3269,3272,3275,3278,3281,3284],[152,2920,2921],{},"Vultureâs City",[152,2923,2924],{},"A day of life in the Era of SilenceÂ ",[152,2926,2927],{},"By R.

The smoke cloud that filled my lungs was thick and harsh, accented with a citrus twinge. I held my breath and stared upward. From my rooftop, I had a perfect view of the glittering amethyst hexagons that made up the dome-shaped environmental shield. It always gave you something pretty to look at when you tilted your head up. Above it, a rolling tide of grey clouds with orange blots where the persevering dawn struggled to break through. I frowned slightly, it was another dreary day.",[152,2955,2956],{},"I exhaled a little too late and coughed for ten seconds at least. My vision went white and the sounds of morning dissolved into a dizzy, oxygen-deprived hum. I glanced around in a half-high, half-conscious haze, worried I had made a scene in front of a neighbor. Of course, no one was up there that early. My mornings on top of Pier 17âs stacks were usually solitary, and I liked it that way.Â ",[152,2958,2959],{},"I took another drag of the joint, it was a decent blend. Most heavier drugs didnât work on me, because of my condition. This strain was homegrown by one of my neighbors, Uri. She was former clergy, and the naturalistic botany she practiced in service of Drais, The Gardener produced a smokable plant that my system could process, unlike the synthetics carried in most stores. Buying from her guaranteed an extra hour of conversation, but sometimes I learned something about church life. I took one more drag, put the joint out, coughed again, and blinked slowly. My vision was a little blurrier and my mind drifted a little. I closed my eyes.",[152,2961,2962],{},"I reached into my pocket and grabbed a small stone. I closed my palm around it, and began to murmur prayers. I prayed for the usual things. I prayed for my parents back east, for money, for good health, and for good fortune on the next excursion- that sort of thing. Then I sat in silence, listening to the beating of water against the concrete dock and the distant caws of a port raven.Â ",[152,2964,2965],{},"In the stillness, I began looking at the scene through the lens of an imagined resograph. Not a detailed image, but rather the very threads of reality that wrapped around it all. I saw the rectangular outlines of every tower of makeshift apartments and the expanse of the city beyond them. I saw my place, its roof, and the little nook I had worked so hard to make for myself. At the center was a girl with one arm, fairly tall even when kneeling, with a bowed head. She was Alice Talin. She was me. Moments of peace had been rare recently, but from this point of view, it didnât seem so bad.Â ",[152,2967,2968],{},"A couple of shouts from the street below pulled me back into reality. I opened my eyes and peeked over the roofâs edge. The neighborhood kids were out early, playing some variant of a tag game. I chuckled. I wasnât old by any means but I couldnât fathom having that much energy.",[152,2970,2971],{},"I unfolded my hand and glanced at the stone. It was teal, with a compass icon etched into its face. An icon of St. Kathen, the Pathfinder. My mother gave this to me when I turned 13 âso I would always find my way back to herâ. I smiled and tucked it into my pocket; it was always with me.Â ",[152,2973,2974],{},"I wrapped the cloth underlay of my prayer setup around the rest of the components. I carefully lifted the bundle and made my way down the roof hatch.",[152,2976,2977],{},"My apartment was cozy, in the way that cozy doesnât always mean comfortable. A former storage container converted into a tight 1 bedroom, the same as the rest of Pier 17. I kicked down the folded stairs and made a careful descent. The hatchâs seal hissed behind me, a little strained. Iâd need to replace the tubing soon. I did the cost calculation in my head and felt a knot form in my stomach. Money was never easy, but medical expenses had left things tighter than usual.Â ",[152,2979,2980],{},"I set the prayer bundle down in its spot and flipped on the radio, tuned to Dr. Swellâs talk show. Swell, an energetic DJ on a pirate frequency, had a bent for conspiracy theories. He was rambling on about a discrepancy in caravan records. He claimed this proved that the Empire of Astael was making traders disappear. I didnât know anything about it, but it wouldnât be surprising if true. I continued, half listening as I got dressed for the day. I had work later.",[152,2982,2983],{},"For someone with my condition, jobs are hard to come by. I couldnât receive the chemical surgeries required to get specialized work, and even normal jobs were harder without the ability to metabolize potions. When I lost my arm in the war, I couldnât get a replacement; normal employment became the object of distant dreams.",[152,2985,2986],{},"Those days, my tasks came from men like Oren Maklivi, who fancied himself a talent broker for those who couldnât turn to conventional means. If you needed something recovered from the wastelands, and you couldnât turn to legitimate means, you hired a contractor from the underworld Community. If the Community wouldnât touch the job, you called someone like Oren to find help. At the end of this chain of channels and backchannels were freelance scavengers like me. Scavvers, theyâd call us. People braveâ or desperate enough to go into the wastelands alone. Â ",[152,2988,2989],{},"Yesterday, I got word via a messenger drone that Oren had work for me. I was expected to leave the city by the end of the day. I slipped on a simple shirt and pants, earthy colors. I had tucked the joint behind my ear while I worked on my jacket. Genuine leather was expensive, but my parents enjoyed modest wealth. They had it dyed a patriotic purple and had a gold gryphon sewn into the right shoulder, standard colors for Astaelâs now-defunct Royal Army. They were so proud the day I enlisted. I didnât like how the shoulders rested on my frameâ much too masculineâ but I had missed my parents since they moved. So I kept finding excuses to wear it; I just balanced the look with some makeup.",[152,2991,2992],{},"Swell had swapped to music. Something from a singing construct that went by Chytri Ganoda. Not my style, too synthetic and poppy. The tech was impressive, though. Those units were getting smarter by the day, it seemed. I finished carefully putting on a bit of eyeliner and switched off the radio.Â ",[152,2994,2995],{},"In a fluid, well-rehearsed motion, I grabbed my prosthetic off the table and worked it onto the stump where my right arm was. Some careful mechanical rigging had allowed me limited motion with the digits. There were slots for modular inserts on the wrist for tools and the like, but I didnât have anything installed today.Â ",[152,2997,2998],{},"Next, I opened up my work bag and checked the contents. I had some gloves, climbing gear, a first aid kit, a space heater, and wind-shielded tenting in case I had to spend the night outside of the cityâs border. Then of course the complex mix of metal bars, screws, and wiring that made up my crossbow. The weaponâs metal frame was collapsed and bundled into a metal rectangle with some bolts covered in electrical wiring. Finally, a rebreather; a small metal mask that wrapped around the face. A must-have for open-air exposure - even in the city only the foolhardy walked without one. My kit was simple as most scavvers went, but traveling light kept me nimble.",[152,3000,3001],{},"I packed up my things and slung the bag over my shoulder. I began to move toward the door but remembered to feed the fish first. When the food hit their water, the three of them shifted to a pleasant magenta, and they began to feast. I flipped the switch on the light and stumbled my way through my dark apartment. Furniture had to be inventively placed in a space as small as this, and walking it blind was an exercise in memory.",[152,3003,3004],{},"At the front hatch, I pressed the unseal button and waited for it to depressurize. I winced as my eyes adjusted to the brightness of the hazy morning. The cloud cover was heavy enough that it didnât take long, but for a moment everything seemed so bright. I was now outside, on top of the scaffolding that stretched alongside rows and columns of improvised housing that stretched along the docks. Iâd seen one of my neighbors take a nasty spill on a rusted-out step, so I always went down slowly. Inspectors didnât often make their way out here.",[152,3006,3007],{},"I passed by Old Man Rorik, sitting with his airlock open and horn music coming from inside the unit. He gave me a nod and a smile but didnât say much else. We were a neighborhood, but a lot of us kept to ourselves. Most of us preferred it that way.Â ",[152,3009,3010],{},"Overall, I enjoyed my time there, and it was as affordable as New Bekton went. Some rent control policies from the old administration were still in effect. My unit was one of the cheapest in the city, which worked for my strange and inconsistent income. My landlord was as nice as a housing baron could be, he even cut a hundred off my rent when he learned I was a former Royalist. There werenât many friends of the Empire in this ring of the city.Â ",[152,3012,3013],{},"At the bottom of the scaffolding, the dock was a mix of mercrete and metal plating. New Bekton was a city on an island, which placed a limit on its growth. To avoid unnecessary infrastructure spending, the old Royal government sanctioned a group of piers to become emergency housing. That was 70 years ago, and any chance of a permanent solution under the new Imperial government was even less likely than under those before them. Pier 17 a fact of life. It wasnât always the worst thing that it was.Â ",[152,3015,3016],{},"I crossed the dock to a group of skimmers. Vehicles that resembled a larger brass tube and a smaller steel tube fused together. Some of my neighbors were rich enough to own one of them, sectioned off in a private parking lot. Otherwise, the floating cars were the property of the Wakenfern Transit Authority. I picked the one closest to me and got inside. The interior was fairly simple, with a bit of graffiti on the dash. Certainly, it was clean and comfortable enough, albeit barebones. The radio worked, and that was enough for me.",[152,3018,3019],{},"I flipped to Dr. Swellâs show, now interviewing an ash farmer. I caught the conversation in the middle so I didnât entirely get what was happening, but it seemed that they were discussing the ethics of a new alchemical pesticide used on ash yams. Specifically, its effect on the wine supply. Yam wine was a wasteland staple, the segment would do quite well.Â ",[152,3021,3022],{},"I reached for the ignition, a hole a couple of inches wide next to the control stick. I stuck my left finger in and winced as the needle pierced my skin. I withdrew my finger and held it tight while the machine processed my reading. I had registered when I got my license, like most kids. It would reference my genetic material and charge it to my account. I couldnât remember my balance but I was certain I had enough for the day. Â ",[152,3024,3025],{},"The simple dashboard display scrolled a âWelcomeâ to an old name I mentally blurred out. âEnjoy your ride!â and the vehicle hummed to life. I buckled in and flipped the brake lock. With a slight lurch, the skimmer lifted off the ground, orienting with me in the brass passenger tube on top, and the propulsion tube on bottom. I did a quick check for other vehicles, drone traffic, and everything else they train you to be worried about in flight school. I pulled the stick and began the climb to travel altitude.Â ",[152,3027,345],{},[152,3029,3030],{},"From the aerial vantage point, it became apparent why New Bekton was called The City of Rings. The island city was comprised of three tiered circles, ascending towards the center. The messy outer ring, Lowtown, is where I had spent most of my adult life. The middle ring, Midtown, was corporations, entertainment, and academia. Government and religious institutions centered in the highest Uptown ring. At the center of it all was a massive spire that shot past the environmental shield, the cloudline, the sky, and into the void, thus named the Voidspire. Lights were everywhere, and the airspace was smothered with traffic. The city strained against its island constraints, but somehow there was always a little more room for another development.Â ",[152,3032,3033],{},"Different parts of the city had their own unique energies. Pier 17 was a fairly chill place where people lay low. The same could be said of the adjacent South Lowtown, which had other low-income housing. North Lowtown was different. It was no nicer than any other part of the outer ring. The affluent parts of the city were the middle and center. However, the people in North Lowtown were hungrier than their southern counterparts. They had more drive. A day in the North Lowtown shops was always a pleasure.",[152,3035,3036],{},"I left my rental at another rental station and started walking. I kept my head down to avoid the constant stream of poster ads, something you learned to do if you wanted to get through a walk on city streets without a panic attack. I stayed close to the sidewalk's edge, doing my best to stay out of the way. Several buildings on the street had been closed down in a police raid. I craned my neck and looked for uniforms. Imperial blues, not New Bekton Law Enforcement olive. They were grabbing people for questioning. Best to get moving quickly. I darted a sharp right down the recently renamed Courage Lane, part of the new adminâs initiative to promote patriotism.Â ",[152,3038,3039],{},"There were a few nice businesses here, I often went down Courage to shop on an off day. The Azure Cat bar played soft Nur Fasaani folk music out of its opened airlock to my left. A young woman with spliced-on gills and a clipboard started to talk to me about corp recruitment. I made that hand gesture that was polite enough to acknowledge the person but firmly communicated âNot today.â My eyes wandered over a couple of pop-up market stalls that called to passersby on the right. I eyed a particularly cute doll in one of their displays, but the pathetic jingle in my coin purse reminded me that I didnât have enough money for a detour. I frowned, then shrugged. Those stalls hiked up their prices anyway. The shop I needed lay just beyond.",[152,3041,3042],{},"Korvunâs Finest Apothecary was an unassuming old house that had been converted into a storefront through some questionably legal remodeling. Zealously placed signs advertised it as âNew Bektonâs premier apothecarium.â They often opened late so I was hoping I had not come too early. The flashing âOpenâ sign rewarded my faith. I pressed the bright red button on the airlock and waited for it to cycle. These commercial ones were required to be larger than personal units like the one on the front of my place, unsealing them often took longer.Â ",[152,3044,3045],{},"The airlock opened and I entered into a small waiting room with a bunch of lockers and seats. Â Most commercial buildings were required to offer shelter in the event of environmental shield failure. The interior chamber of the airlock had the painted image of a small plant rising out of a pile of dirt, colorful little bulbs hinting at fruit to come. It was a cute logo, I figured the shopkeeper's child made it, apparently, they were going for an art degree at the cityâs premier University.Â ",[152,3047,3048],{},"Inside, the storefront was arranged to promote serenity. There was no overhead lighting. Instead, what illumination there was came from the interior lining of glass cases filled with plants. The lights were a celadon green, and cast a vibrant glow across the room, a thematic attempt at representing moonlight. In the shadows, menacingly lit by the lowered lighting was a tall and lumbering figure. I heard the metal floor thud and clack with heavy clawed steps as they approached me.Â ",[152,3050,3051],{},"I smiled and looked up, they were a couple of feet taller than me. âMorning Haela!â I said warmly. Haela was good people. They were a Primas-ika, tall and bulky reptiles. Their scales were a light grey but shone green in the light. Their curved horns were slightly outlined and the gold caps on them reflected a little shine, and their long false hair was braided around their shoulders. Haela smiled, revealing a mouth full of glistening sharp teeth. âAlice, my girl! Howâs your week been?â",[152,3053,3054],{},"âAh you know how it is, a couple jobs here and there. Howâs the shop?â",[152,3056,3057],{},"This exchange was fairly routine. We talked about our days, my days in Pier 17, my social life, their work, their childâs career, and more. Haela began to retrieve my usual medication. They pulled out a couple of jars of different colored herbs and began to powder them up with an old-fashioned mortar and pestle. I enjoyed Haelaâs shop for the focus on artisanal craftship at fairly reasonable prices. Whatâs more, not many people were experts on my condition, especially ones that I could afford without insurance.",[152,3059,3060],{},"Â âSoâ¦â Haela signaled the change in subject to more direct business, âHave you been spending more time outside the shield?â",[152,3062,3063],{},"The dim light of the room hid me from paling. We were doing this again, âYeah, professional requirement.â",[152,3065,3066],{},"Haelaâs sharpened teeth made a hissing sound of admonishment, âYou shouldnât be out there.â",[152,3068,3069],{},"âI know, I-â",[152,3071,3072],{},"They continued without pause. âThe wildlife and other hazards aside, the air alone will corrode your lungs.â",[152,3074,3075],{},"âI wear a rebreather, Haela.â I tried to give a thoughtful smile. Haela was a kind soul, just opinionated.Â ",[152,3077,3078],{},"The aged Primas-ika laughed, âBah, rebreathers. Do you think a waster wears a mask every day and doesnât look different when cut open? At least they have tinctures and cleansing pills. Youâve only got the-â They stopped to count. âTwo, two lungs my girl!â",[152,3080,3081],{},"I stammered, âHaela, I- I- I get it. Thank you for looking out for me but itâs what Iâm doing for now.â I wanted to defend myself, say I was good at it, say that it made me feel alive. I chose to leave it at the assurance.Â ",[152,3083,3084],{},"Haela sighed, âOf course. Iâm going to add some Moranâs Root to your supplements. It promotes respiratory health. Take a double dose when youâre out in the wastes. Youâre 27 right?â",[152,3086,3087],{},"âYes,â I was surprised they remembered, I was only vaguely aware that they were in their 50s.Â ",[152,3089,3090],{},"âItâs been a while since medical school, but if I recall, humans stop replenishing cells at a positive rate around that age. Most folks would just take a regen potion butâ¦â They paused thoughtfully as if deciding something internally. They moved on from the thought, grabbed a handful of a root, and shaved off a few flecks into the gathered ingredients before them.",[152,3092,3093],{},"âI get you.â I nodded. Â âMaybe Iâll win the lottery and kick it in Nur Fasaan.â We both did that little small talk laugh where nothing said was very funny but we were trying to keep it light. I appreciated Haela, they had been my go-to since I could make my own medical decisions.Â ",[152,3095,3096],{},"People with Nuralis Syndrome donât tend to live long. It was rare, one in ten thousand humans was born without the ability to process advanced alchemy and augmentations. The things that kept most city-dwellers healthy without natural sunlight or good food sources. Doctors didnât give me long. I wasnât supposed to live long past 20. The gods had been kind to me, and I tried to repay that gift with my service when I could.Â ",[152,3098,3099],{},"My parents had been protective of me growing up, I wasnât allowed to do much because they were worried Iâd get hurt in some way that I couldnât fix without a potion. Though they were proud of me for signing onto the Astaelian Royal Army, they had frequently urged me to take a support role. They went overseas during the war and never found out about my arm. I almost bled out because the medic didnât know how to apply normal bandaging without a healing salve to seal the wound.Â ",[152,3101,3102],{},"Haela would sometimes check the scar and apply ointments and creams to try to return the skin to normal. They were the closest thing to a doctor I could see; most wouldnât know what to do with me. Without the ability to integrate into chemical society most people with Nuralis Syndrome were left on the edge of civilization. âOrganicsâ they called us because we were more or less the same as the day we were born.Â ",[152,3104,3105],{},"Haela finished mixing the bowl and started pouring it into a small machine that placed the blend into small pills. When done, it produced a bottle of a monthâs worth of supplements and vitamins. They looked up at me, âDo you have enough hormones?â",[152,3107,3108],{},"I thought about it, and shrugged, âNo harm in stocking up.â Gender transition for most people was as simple as a specially prepared drink or a salve. Some chemically assisted surgery here and there. I wasnât so lucky, I had to rely on direct hormone replacement and old-fashioned surgical techniques. It was my life, though. I liked living, and it wasnât like I was going to give up my identity. Haela was great for that too, with old-school know-how and the biolab they had in the back.",[152,3110,3111],{},"By most observations, I was healthier than most organics and I credited that to the apothecaryâs amazing work. They were not cheap, which I was reminded of as I handed a small pile of crystalline coins to Haela. They did the math, made changes, and we said our goodbyes. On the way out I stopped by the little shrine to Iudan, The Healer. I whispered a small prayer of thanks for the bounty. Haela went back to work and I slipped out the door.Â ",[152,3113,3114],{},"I walked out of Haelaâs shopâs airlock and popped one of the pills. I washed it down with my canteen. The hormones Iâd need to take at home with one of my syringes. I stood off to the side of the stoop and lit my joint again. Natural hemp was in no way addictive, but I relied on it to drown out a background radiation of anxiety that came with the fast-paced New Bekton life. I took my first drag and exhaled into the air as pedestrians avoided me. For all the faults of the new Imperial government, they had eased restrictions on public smoking in the city-states, which was fine by me.Â ",[152,3116,3117],{},"Then I heard it. âAdrian!â I stopped dead. âAdrian!â the voice repeated in my direction. I looked around, hoping they meant someone else. In a panic my neck whipped around, looking for the source. I reached for a pistol that wasnât on my hip. My breathing was fast. I cursed my illness, that I couldnât transition like others, with their fancy chems and surgeries. I cursed myself for forgetting to shave that morning and wearing such a masculine jacket. I cursed the gods that would put me in this wretched form and insist I live with it. One last time I heard it, like the invocation of some kind of old and vile magick, âAdrian!âÂ ",[152,3119,3120],{},"I located the voice, an elek standing about 5 feet tall. He had prematurely grey hair, those trademark irisless brass eyes most of the species had, and long, rounded ears studded with earrings that protruded half a foot from either side of his head. He was doing the thing that eleks do where they stand on the tips of their toes and ponder the situation. Then the recognition clicked. I knew this man. He cocked his head and slightly frowned, I could see him reacting to the look on my face, and considering if he had made an error. He carefully and apologetically, âSo sorry maâam, I think there was a misunderstanding.â",[152,3122,3123],{},"Panic and rage washed over into relief and joy, âTarâIl?â I said though the voice that came from me is not the one he probably remembered. He perked up, âA-â he stopped himself, and considered the situation. I was just glad this was a friendly face, the worst-case scenarios that had been flooding my mind drifted away. âAlice, my name is Alice now. Itâs been years Tarâil!â I was smiling, in part because it helps cis people feel comfortable after an incident, but also because I was just so happy to see him.Â ",[152,3125,3126],{},"âNo shit!â Tarâil laughed. âHowâve you been? Is this where youâre holing up these days?âÂ ",[152,3128,3129],{},"âYeah, I live over in the Pier 17 development. Cheap waterfront property. Landlordâs nephew was another violetcoat.â",[152,3131,3132],{},"âAnother Royalist! Good on him! You know what battalion?âÂ ",[152,3134,3135],{},"I frowned and looked away, âThe 21st.âÂ ",[152,3137,3138],{},"âOhâ¦â Tarâil trailed off for a second too. Everyone knew what became of the 21st at the end of the war. After that mournful instant TarâIl tried to recover. âWell hey, I was just about to head to a Hungry Reihnâs a couple blocks down. You want a bite? Iâm buying.â",[152,3140,3141],{},"I rolled my eyes, âDo you live here?â",[152,3143,3144],{},"âNo no, just visiting.â",[152,3146,3147],{},"âOf course you are, thatâs tourist food. Come on, thereâs a cute little cafe that just opened up on Victory Boulevard.â",[152,3149,3150],{},"We spent the next couple of hours catching up. We talked about our time in the war, my arm, our old CO. We had been in the same unit for a time. After the Royalists lost most of us scattered to the wind. Most of us took our skills wherever we could get paid. TarâIl was in town for work, and we had been luckily in the same place at the same time.Â ",[152,3152,3153],{},"He said he worked in security and I said I worked in reclamation and we kept it at that. It was best to not ask questions about these sorts of things. We discussed the completion of the Voidspire, and how New Bekton had gone from a port town to a tech hub in just a decade. The sorts of conversations you have with an old friend you know you wonât see again for a long time.Â ",[152,3155,3156],{},"When we left the cafe, TarâIl pulled me aside. We stood by the side door of the cafe in an alley. TarâIl waited for a drone to pass by overhead, then looked at me. âSo, you keep up with the Front at all?â",[152,3158,3159],{},"Â That cold headrush of disappointment hit me as I realized what was happening.",[152,3161,3162],{},"He continued, âWe could use someone like you, Alice. Not even out there in the wastes, we need fighters right here in New Bekton!â He gestured to the Imperial drone floating away, and whispered, âYou think these fuckers are gonna go away on their own?â",[152,3164,3165],{},"âI donât do that anymore Tar, and I donât appreciate the feeling that you just wanted to give the sales pitch.â",[152,3167,3168],{},"He held his mouth open as he thought of what to say, Eleks were usually fast with their words but he was clearly trying to be careful. âAlice no- I- Iâm so glad to see you. Iâm in town to do some work for them. I canât tell you what.â",[152,3170,3171],{},"âI know.â I nodded reassuringly.",[152,3173,3174],{},"âThings are just bad out there, we need people like you.â",[152,3176,3177],{},"âTar, dear, Iâve had this talk before with others from the unit. I respect what youâre doing but the answerâs no.â I gave that disarming smile again.Â ",[152,3179,3180],{},"âYouâre a good one, Alice. Donât let the wasteland life turn you sour.â",[152,3182,3183],{},"âHasnât yet,â and we laughed, clasped arms, and said our goodbyes. He gave me the address of his hotel in case I needed to get in touch, but we both knew that this was probably the last time weâd see each other for a while.Â ",[152,3185,3186],{},"I think a lot about that encounter. How just by happenstance we had been in the same district at the same time. How New Bekton pushes people together by making itself a necessity. It was the last time I got to talk to him. He was executed at an Imperial checkpoint a couple of months later.Â ",[152,3188,3189],{},"When my mind wanders I start wishing I had said more. That I told him how much his camaraderie meant to me, even if we didnât keep in touch. Maybe I could have told him that the girl I was fucking makes fake licenses and IDs. Maybe he could have gotten some fake papers for the lash pistol the fascists found in his bag. Would he still be here? Thought exercises, little more. TarâIl was gone, another proud son of Astael cut down by those who claimed to defend it.Â ",[152,3191,345],{},[152,3193,3194],{},"There were four main ways out of New Bekton. By boat, in the harbor, was common for commerce and shipping. The new Voidspire went into orbit and connected voidships to stations around the planet. Then there was South-Gate, which was mostly corporate convoys and well-licensed caravans. I was foot traffic, so West-Gate was my usual exit and entrance.Â ",[152,3196,3197],{},"Customs and Processing had been run by a branch of New Bekton Law Enforcement until recently, part of the Imperial takeover of the cityâs operations. Normal business casual attire had been replaced by militarized cobalt blue armor and matching civilian jumpsuits. The environmental shield wrapped into the cityâs border wall and its glowing amethyst energy hexagons added a persistent buzzing noise that added to the tension. I caught myself grinding my teeth more than once. Though, maybe that had more to do with the blood-stained wall behind the main office.Â ",[152,3199,3200],{},"I had my bag on my back and my gear ready. I made sure to stow my Royalist jacket in my pack and was down to my earth tones. My full-face rebreather was buried in my red-brown hair, ready to be brought down quickly. We were close to the gate now and it made me edgy. The line moved at an agonizingly slow pace, I checked the time on my wristwatch. 8:32 PM. Oren was expecting my return by 9 AM tomorrow.Â ",[152,3202,3203],{},"The main office had a booth in its front and guards nearby in any direction. The old human man in front of me had grafted a third leg onto his lower torso that he used to sit. I didnât normally find myself envying chemical augments, but as the wait went into half an hour, I wished I could sit the same. At one point this would have been twenty minutes, tops.Â ",[152,3205,3206],{},"An hour later, I was at the front of the line. The clerk was a woman with greying dark hair kept in a tight bun. This part of the exchange was familiar enough. I said my name was Alice Talin, she asked if it was spelled Allis like the god, I corrected and said with a C and an E. I handed over my city ID for reference. She asked my business and I gave it, scavenging was no crime as long as you stayed away from unsanctioned areas. She asked for my license and I paused. This was new.Â ",[152,3208,3209],{},"âDo you need to check for Class C scavenging?â I went a little outside the drudgery of old power cells and foodstuffs of Class C, but she didnât know that.Â ",[152,3211,3212],{},"âNew policy, all salvage licenses are processed upon city exit. We confirm transit tickets too. Tamps down on seditionist fraud.â",[152,3214,3215],{},"I clenched my jaw and went into the recesses of my wallet. I produced a different card than my usual ID and handed it to the clerk. She looked at it and frowned, âThis says Adrian Mercier-Durante.â",[152,3217,3218],{},"âYes, Iâve been in the process of legally changing my name but the paperwork got delayed.â",[152,3220,3221],{},"Her lips pursed, âSo your name is Adrian.â",[152,3223,3224],{},"âMy name is Alice, I just need to get it-â",[152,3226,3227],{},"âAll official comings and goings from the city must be done in legal name- real name, only.â",[152,3229,3230],{},"âAlice is my real name.âÂ ",[152,3232,3233],{},"âNot according to the Imperial Authority of New Bekton.â She paused, and a smirk crept into her expression, âNor the official stance of the Divinist Church, Mr. Mercier-Durante.âÂ ",[152,3235,3236],{},"My face was red from heat, same story all over this fucking city. âThis is my fucking job! Youâre really gonna-â In my screaming, I stepped forward. The Imperial guards were on me before I could even register the metal gauntlets around my shoulders. âLET ME THE FUCK GO!â I bucked. One of them drew a gun. I saw the look in the clerkâs eyes, she wanted it to happen. âHandle him,â she waved her hand and threw my IDs back at me.Â ",[152,3238,3239],{},"A squeaky male voice interjected, âSTOP!â",[152,3241,3242],{},"The scene paused, everyone in line behind me, the guards, the clerk, and myself all waiting with bated breath. An elek with silver eyes and one ear bigger than the other rushed up. The last time I had seen him he was wearing a button-up and a professional neckband. Now he was in one of the blue jumpsuits. I didnât know his full name, I just called him Norm.Â ",[152,3244,3245],{},"âShe-â He considered how to approach the situation, âTheyâre in the NBLE system. A Schedule J Amended form was filed to bring the two records into sync. You should still have access to it in your files.â",[152,3247,3248],{},"The look on the clerkâs face Iâd only seen in spellcasters trying to conjure some deadly trick. She rubbed her temples and sighed. Her chair swiveled to a terminal next to her station and some keys clacked under her glowing manicured nails. She was quiet for a minute. âLet him go.â She swiveled back, âGet your IDs in order, Iâm going to file a 7-B to have this nullified. For now, you may go.â",[152,3250,3251],{},"The guards let me go, I picked up my IDs in a hurry and scurried towards Norm, who shuttled me towards the gate in time for the 9 pm cycle. I thanked him up and down and he was kind enough. âIâd do it for anyone. The blue-â he stopped, looked around for listeners, and continued, âBluebacks just donât remember their mortal nature anymore. I canât help you like this again, get your papers in orderâ¦ itâs only going to get worse.â I nodded and slipped him a 20-piece coin as a thanks. I brought my rebreather down on my face and got ready for the gates to open.Â ",[152,3253,345],{},[152,3255,3256],{},"Across the west bridge, I snagged a rental buggy. This part of the outskirts was industrialized. Lots of buildings and small towns supported factories and massive farms. An hour out it got more sparse. The clouds were thick tonight, so the only lights were the city behind me and the headlights carving the darkness ahead of me.Â ",[152,3258,3259],{},"The car climbed a hill and took a turn. For a second I could see New Bekton from the outside, how it looked to the world. A city guarded by a dome that looked almost fuschia in the starless night. A city on an island. A city that even at that distance was teeming with life. I smiled. The world had ended more than once and still kept going.Â ",[152,3261,3262],{},"I tuned the radio to Dr. Swellâs frequency, now in the nighttime show. Swell had been dealing with fatigue so heâd delegated the nightly music show to his apprentice, a mysterious figure who went by The Fizz. The Fizz lacked the manic energy of his teacher, but always had an interesting fact to share about the artist playing. Tonight was Qiaran jazz, I almost swapped off to something more conventional, but the frenetic string bass had grown on me. I did my best to follow the map that Oren drew me into the night.Â ",[152,3264,3265],{},"Off the road, at the edge of the Gryphonâs Head Peninsula, named because if you looked at the Astaelian Empire on a map, it resembled a perched Gryphon of old. I took a right and buried the buggy in some shrubbery, accidentally scaring a murder of dust-crows that went cackling into the night. Almost like laughing, ha ha ha, ha ha ha. A wry smirk cracked my lips, I wonder now if somehow they knew.Â ",[152,3267,3268],{},"I got out and fell to the ground. I scooped up a handful of ashy dirt and pressed it to my mouth. I blew it away from me in clumps, it had rained a few days ago. I took a couple of contaminated breaths, in and out. Even at night, this place was beautiful. It was free. It didnât matter who I was here, trans, Organic, ex-Royalist, whatever. I could just live. I remembered Haelaâs words, and popped the Moranâs Root pills that I washed down with my canteen, and carried on foot for a while.Â ",[152,3270,3271],{},"In the stillness of the night, it was just locusts and the clicking of my filtered mask. Technically, the area I was entering was the property of the church, but I wasnât in the market for any divine artifacts. My target was a derelict vessel from the Parathan Imperial era. Hundreds of years ago they had heralded the age of alchemy that we still lived in. An unsalvaged vehicle could be host to so many rare finds. Iâd pay my rent for months. If it was military, it might have had some stuff for TarâIlâs front, too.",[152,3273,3274],{},"I flipped a light on my face mask and peered into a crevasse formed by a seismic event. Sure enough, there it was. Made sense why it wasnât found. I thanked the gods for my good fortune and wriggled my way in. I heard a clicking noise. Not my rebreather. I froze, feeling my heart nearly pound out of its chest. Random debris? No, that was a trigger. I looked down, staying as still as I could. I looked down, my left foot was stepping on something metal, brass, cylindrical. Recognition snapped into place and I shambled my way out of the opening as fast as I could. Grenade, grenade, grenade.",[152,3276,3277],{},"It all happened in a matter of seconds and then came the energy blast. Enough of me got out that I didnât die in the detonation immediately. The searing heat in my leg, or what remained of it, sent me to the ground. Through the hideous pain and the ensuing rush of adrenaline, I tried to reach for my injured leg. Half-cauterized by the heat of the explosion. I collapsed, my consciousness fading quickly. I realized my head was resting against something, something firm. My own boot, my own foot, my ankle, my knee.Â ",[152,3279,3280],{},"The pain and blood loss took me elsewhere before the horror could really set in.

It took all her discipline to bite her tongue and keep quiet. She tumbled and ashy mud covered her face wrappings and blotted out her vision. Desperately, she crawled her weakened self underneath a lip of the road above that formed a slight overhang from where she lay.",[152,3537,3538],{},"Mira stayed low and repeated silent prayers to herself. She ran her fingers along an amulet of the 11-pointed star of the Divine Council. With her other arm, she clutched her bag jealousy toward her breast like a mother protecting her child. Ichor from her wound seeped into her protective gear and onto the ground below her. Heavy boots beat against the dirt road above her. Voices muffled by rebreathers exclaimed in frustration that their quarry had eluded them. She put her mouth over her own respirator and tried to hold her breath. She couldnât get caught.

This was everything she had spent the last year trying to find. She had already sent word to her people that she was returning victorious.",[152,3549,3550],{},"She put it back carefully and slung her bag over her good shoulder.

Desperate situations at the cityâs entrance were no strange occurrence.Â ",[152,3564,3565],{},"She wondered if they would just watch as she bled out. No. She couldnât. She was so close.

She took her bag off her unwounded shoulder and searched for an ID. When she handed it over, she realized she had smudged it in blood. The customs officer barely noticed. He scrawled some information down on a clipboard. She managed to get out that she was returning home with a delivery. When asked what she was carrying, she remembered the Fatherâs warning to identify it as familial relics.Â ",[152,3570,3571],{},"Of course, he demanded a fee. There were dark spots in her vision as if she was viewing the world through a cardboard tube. She got the money out of her bagâs wallet pouch and handed it over.

Her breathing was shallow and fast. She made it inside the opened gate, though not much further. She slumped against a divider near customs, but an officer pushed her back with the butt of a rifle.

He wore wasteland gear like hers, but with rounded spectacles and a patch on his shoulder that said Medic, âHey hey, now. Stay awake, lass.

She thought of Vili and wondered what would become of him.",[152,4070,4071],{},"Father Cyran went forward to the operating table, carrying the canister. She kneeled there and watched as the surgeon began to work. First, the old eyes were removed, and placed on a tray. One eye, and then the other. The smell of cut bone and chemical solvents mixed with the candles and incense into a confused medley. A wet âschlickâ sound as the new eyes were set. Then there was quiet for some time.Â ",[152,4073,4074],{},"The three waited and waited for some time longer than that. Then Father Cyranâs new eyes opened, red and shiny as rubies. He looked first to the surgeon and thanked him. Then he stood up, head bumping against the lamp. He went over to Mira, whose stimulant was beginning to fade.

Most of her days were dark and quiet, kept away in the reserves of the Sanctum. She spent many of her days singing the hymns she knew and even writing new ones. She had all the time in the world.

You reached into your jacket and pulled out a pistol, already loaded. You spun around and fired just as the thunderclap responded.

His gun fired into the air aimlessly, a futile gesture of defense.Â ",[152,4343,4344],{},"Blood spattered the dirt and plants, and the body spasmed a couple more times. You averted your gaze and tried to calm your shallow breath. Your horse had panicked from the shot and ran off into the distance.

You acted without your mind, and dragged the body- now surely dead- off to the side of the road.Â ",[152,4346,4347],{},"It was mandated by faith and law to burn the dead, even if you were the killer. Of course, no court or sheriff would ever hold you to account for what you did. You were no murderer, just a person protecting yourself.

You worked closely with your brother managing a harvester. You did this for a great deal of time, but wanderlust had always tugged at your heart. Your life was elsewhere.

First you noticed the scarlet paint on the rocks was washing off. Was that paint? Over the rain a hum could be heard, louder and louder. A rumble like thunder but too quiet for that.

In the distance, but clearly enough, you saw the shadowed outline of a figure on a bike riding toward you.Â ",[152,4381,4382],{},"There was no way it was him, you had certainly sunk enough lead in that manâs body that even redundant vital organ implants wouldnât have saved him.

There was no one else on this road, and he was gaining.Â ",[152,4384,4385],{},"You did not wait to confirm your suspicions, you kicked the side of your horse and broke into a sprint as fast and far down the road as you could. It was no use, the motorcycle was going to overtake you. Your eyes scanned the horizon for terrain to go into. A petrified forest gave the most obvious hope of escape. Your heart pounded with the beating hooves beneath you. You cleared into the forest and maneuvered at top speed around long dead trees.",[152,4387,4388],{},"You were looking back to confirm you were making distance. You didnât see the stray root in front of you. The horse let out a hideous whine of pain and tumbled into the ground, launching you forward. You rolled head first into a log, and the world went black.",[152,4390,4391],{},"You did not die there, not yet. Though the blinding pain you woke up to made you wish you had. When you came to and the confusion settled, your hands went to your face, and you felt the blood soaking your coverings. You could barely breathe through your broken nose. You panted out of your mouth raggedly and your heart and head pounded in sadistic unison. A terrible noise was coming from not too far away from you. You sloshed out of the soggy ground and sat against the log to get a better view of the scene.",[152,4393,4394],{},"The bike was nowhere to be seen. You had lost him, or whoever that was, but your horse was crying out in pain. Two of its legs were apparently broken. You felt a twinge of sadness for it, then a rush of fear as you knew that your pursuer might hear. You crawled through the mud over to the beast. Only your nose had been broken but the pain in your body was too intense for you to stand on your own.Â ",[152,4396,4397],{},"You got next to the beast and stayed clear of the poison barbed tail that thrashed wildly around its hindquarters. A knife went uneasily into the creatureâs hardened throat, and with some effort on your end you managed to sever its major veins and arteries. The equine blood you were sprayed with merged with your own and your clothes had become a macabre showcase of reds and browns. The horse looked at you with terror in its eyes, it did not understand what had happened to it, or why it had to die now. It kicked and spasmed, and its eyes rolled into its head. It died scared, and you looked away to spare yourself the guilt that bubbled within you.Â ",[152,4399,4400],{},"When it was quiet, and when the pain you felt became manageable, you made yourself stand. You assessed yourself for wounds. Nothing serious, though youâd need to apply some healing formula to a gash on your nose, and your hip where you snagged a branch. You collected the crate and whatever supplies you could carry. You made camp there that night, carefully. Then you wandered out.",[152,4402,4403],{},"It occurred to you that you werenât sure which direction you were going. The gnarled brambles and broken trees didnât give much in the way of landmarks. You thought you identified a unique formation of a fallen tree balanced on the limbs of two others, but there were at least two other instances of that. You kept limping until eventually in the distance you saw buildings. You thanked the gods and pressed forward.Â ",[152,4405,4406],{},"The structures were unusual, antiquated. Wood siding, hatch roofs, windows. No visible airlocks outside of any of them, though youâd heard that some recent designs had tried to obscure those. You approached, the weight of your gear on your back and the box in your hands compelling you to rest.Â ",[152,4408,4409],{},"You collapsed near a well, another antiquated design. No machinery you could see. Were they really just pumping water from the ground unfiltered? Maybe they had filters in the houses themselves.Â ",[152,4411,4412],{},"You craned your neck toward the town, two rows of houses down a main street. Not a single shop, bar, town hall, or anything else youâd expect to see. Isolated settlements werenât unusual, but to have nothing besides housing was odd. A faint mist crept at the fringes and swallowed the distance. Leftover from the rains perhaps.Â ",[152,4414,4415],{},"Â You tried to figure out what kind of place this was, and then you heard the laughter of children approaching. They rounded the well and you saw them. 5 children dressed for St. Draliaâs Day, monsters and popular figures from all across the world. Their leader wore a red cape and a mask that bore the image of one of those titanic lizards from out west, a drak. You blinked and rubbed your eyes. You wondered if it was already St. Draliaâs Day. You wondered further why the kids werenât wearing any apparent breathing protection in the open air.Â ",[152,4417,4418],{},"They stared a while longer, and you stared back. The one in the drak mask pointed and spoke, âBloody rags!â and started to laugh. The other kids began to laugh and sing along, âBloody rags! Bloody rags!â They circled the well a couple of times, dancing and chanting their song. You got to your feet and began to walk. The mist had intensified but you could see everything within settlement, more or less.Â ",[152,4420,4421],{},"They pursued you briefly but then broke off to a house. They knocked on the door. An adult in normal clothes opened the door and passed treats out to the assorted receptacles held by the kids. You looked back, and when they were done, the adult just stared at you. Face blank, eyes filled with something you couldnât identify, but made you walk faster.",[152,4423,4424],{},"The process repeated, groups of kids rang doorbells across the street, treats were passed out, and the occupants of the houses just stared at you. You were not too far from civilization, or at least you didnât think you were. These people acted like they hadnât seen an outsider in months. Years maybe. You resolved within yourself to clear this town and get back to the main road. You wanted to ask for directions, but you felt youâd find no answers here. The mist was consuming you now.Â ",[152,4426,4427],{},"As you approached the edge of town the kids encircled you again. There were more of them now. Their song had developed, albeit tunelessly. âBloody rags! Bloody rags! Walk a winding road, but there youâll find your end.â You stood silently as they encircled you. From behind, the adults had gathered without protective gear, forming a stoic wall that blocked you from entering town again.Â ",[152,4429,4430],{},"The mist overtook visuals, and the singing grew louder. âBloody rags! Bloody rags! Thought you killed him, but there youâll find your end!â You clutched your things and tried to find an escape but it had grown so thick you couldnât even see a few feet in front of you. Your heart pounded and there was this gnawing chill down your spine. You hadnât been seen when you killed him, when you didnât burn him. You were sure of it. Did someone tell them?Â ",[152,4432,4433],{},"The fog cleared, the singing faded into the distance, and you were alone. No sign of the costumed children, no sign of the mob of adults, and the town that had once been restored and full of life had turned dilapidated and ancient. Long abandoned, and its inhabitants long dead or their descendants moved to a safer location. You were alone on a barren stretch of the wasteland, not far from a road.Â ",[152,4435,4436],{},"You were paralyzed, the events of the last twenty minutes played through your head on repeat. There was no such thing as ghosts, you were sure of that. Though, you were increasingly less sure. You lit one of your cigarettes from the yasre caravan, and let the harmonious melody of buzz and high take you.",[152,4438,4439],{},"When it was burnt down, you carried on for a few hours more in the dark. The Sight you smoked let you move without a lantern, and the world had taken on a faintly light green hue. You spent the whole evening watching the terrain for approaching apparitions or the return of the rider. Finally you slept, and you dreamt of home.",[152,4441,4442],{},"You dreamt of the partner you had left behind when you rode away. You dreamt of your family, and you dreamt of your brother. You were there at your fatherâs funeral again, and he was out on the veranda. They let you use the manor house to do your mourning, the owner of the farm was not cruel, though he was rarely overly kind.Â ",[152,4444,4445],{},"You saw your brother crying out there. Some part of you knew it wasnât just about your father. He carried some unfathomable weight that you could only scratch the surface of. Something you could never truly get your head around, though you tried to in the days that would follow the accident. You thought about going out there, talking to him. You didnât, and only you really know why. So many of your thoughts are unknown to me. When it comes down to it, would it have saved him? Would it have saved you?",[152,4447,345],{},[152,4449,4450],{},"You carried on for a week without much trouble. You managed to use some discretionary funds to buy a horse from a ranch you passed. Youâd still make good time for the commission bonus if you kept up at this speed. The weather had been pleasant enough, and you even got a bit of natural sunlight through breaks in the clouds.Â ",[152,4452,4453],{},"Some natural plantlife dotted the central south wastelands. You werenât far from the place from the Ancestral Glades from which much of the forest life of the continent once stemmed. It had been a comfortable break from the tumultuous start of the journey. No one knew, no one had followed you, and you wondered if the second encounter with that rider was even real. People saw things in the wastelands, too much isolation from life was bad for the mind.",[152,4455,4456],{},"Your new horse was white with a red mane and horns that curled like a ram. It lapped up water from a spring that would have been toxic for you, but was safe for its adjusted internal biology. You enjoyed another cigarette and lowered some of your cloth to get some sun on your skin. It burned your pallid flesh but it felt like being reunited with something missing.Â ",[152,4458,4459],{},"When you heard the engine your heart stopped for a second. Then, not just one engine, but several. A multitude even, cresting the hill from whence you came. You saw trucks, buggies, and bikes pass by until the cloud of ashen dust they kicked up was too thick to see anything clearly. You kept your hand close to your pistol out of well-learned caution, and maybe some paranoia. The convoy continued on without a care for you, but you felt a piercing gaze buried in the crowd.Â ",[152,4461,4462],{},"When it was clear, you wiped your eyes and you checked your things. The box was still on your horseâs back. That wretched box. The one that had made your life such a nightmare for over a week. You had thought about opening it, but magical seals would reveal your treachery and you knew that. The Church would have its retribution and you would die. Still, some part of you so desperately wanted to know what all this was for. Why not carry it by caravan? Air travel? One courier was nothing. You werenât even a real courier by professional standards, more of a delivery person.Â ",[152,4464,4465],{},"You shook your head of the thoughts and looked back to the road, now covered in tire tracks. There was something else in the road, too. Something large, in two pieces. You hesitantly walked over. Then you gasped and fell to your back. You scrambled away and peered over. It was a body, your body, but it couldnât be. The clothes, the height, the build, it was you. Except the head, which had been severed and replaced with a ceramic helmet. On its face a neon painted smile, sloppily scrawled like a kid would draw.Â ",[152,4467,4468],{},"Away from it a few feet was the real head. You walked closely toward it, checking the road and surrounding terrain for traps and watchers. You picked it up with the caution of someone handling a bomb. The face you saw was not yours, but it was close. The hair color, the eye color, all correct. The nose was slightly off, but the message was clear to you nonetheless. You dropped the head and screamed into your hands, trying to muffle it. You collapsed onto the ground and sobbed. Why this had to happen to you, you didnât know. You cursed the job, and considered just dropping the box. You knew this wasnât an option, not if you wanted to survive.Â ",[152,4470,4471],{},"Your only options were to move forward and deliver the crate, or die to them or to this unseen tormentor. You steeled yourself, and you searched the body. You found two things on it, a note, and a small glowing orange capsule. The note was written in wild scrawl, by someone with not much control over their hand. âYou should have burned me.â and a crude drawing of a heart alongside a barely legible skull.Â ",[152,4473,4474],{},"How could he have survived? You were so sure you had done the job. You cursed yourself for not burning him when you should have. It was a sin, the 12th sin in Church canon. You were not an avid practitioner of the faith but reverence for the dead went beyond religion. What if it had been you? You rationalized it, said it was a matter of time. You had been so sure a traveling burner would do the job for you. We like to explain our sins to ourselves in ways that make us out to be more noble than we ever really were. You were no different in this respect.",[152,4476,4477],{},"You took the capsule in hand and collected the two scattered pieces of the body, your body. You burned it, and it did not take long. The stench of flame searing flesh slithered its way into your rebreatherâs vents and stayed there long after the job was done. In mere minutes, the body turned to ash and this poor fool, killed as a pawn in some other game, was put to rest.Â ",[152,4479,4480],{},"You got on your horse and rode as fast as you could away from there.",[152,4482,345],{},[152,4484,4485],{},"You rode for almost a day straight before you found some caves you could convince yourself they were safe enough to take rest in. Another storm was coming and you thanked the gods for the shelter. You were another day from the nearest town.Â ",[152,4487,4488],{},"You saw the lights in the cave and that gave you some pause. You carefully peered inside, and you were fairly sure it wasnât the man you were looking for. Instead, you came inside and found me. I had been waiting for you, but I didnât tell you this. You brought your horse and things in and I greeted you pleasantly. The fire was roaring and I was sitting cross legged in its warmth.Â ",[152,4490,4491],{},"You were taken aback. Perhaps you didnât know what to make of me. After all, I donât wear the protective gear you did. I do not need to do these things to survive out here. I marveled at you. You looked exactly how you did in your mindâs eye, though maybe a little more ragged, and a little shorter.",[152,4493,4494],{},"I offered you a seat, and when you secured your horse you joined me. You had grown so wary by the time we met. You kept your hand near your gun at all times. Maybe you were always like this. I knew so many things about you, but I knew so much less than I wanted to. Even now, youâre a mystery Iâll never get to solve. This is okay, I do not need answers. I appreciated your company all the same.Â ",[152,4496,4497],{},"You regarded me carefully. Perhaps you recognized me but you couldnât figure out where from. It clicked when we introduced ourselves. You said your name, which had such a delightful ring to it. I said mine, and you knew me as âRidlek of Morwood.â You did not believe this was a real name, as St. Ridlek is a figure of legend for you. For me, it is just life. The only life I know.Â ",[152,4499,4500],{},"We talked. You asked me what I was doing out there, and I told you the truth. I was on pilgrimage to the Glades, and then I would continue on to the Veil that bordered the south. I asked you why you were out there, and you told me a lie. Something about going to see your family out in Sidersberg. I let you keep your secrets, we both quietly knew the truth.",[152,4502,4503],{},"I offered you some wine, and you said no at first. I took a swig and let its bitter, metallic taste fill me. I offered again, and this gesture of deference was enough to convince you to say yes. You took out your last two cigarettes and offered me one. We had a delightful evening drunk and high at the fire. You never asked what was in the wine that tasted so strange, and I never told you. It might have mattered, had things gone differently. They did not go differently, so it did not matter.Â ",[152,4505,4506],{},"When we were thoroughly intoxicated, I asked more about you. We talked about a lot of things. Life on the ash farm, life as a delivery person, the differences between delivery men and couriers in Astaelian parlance. You asked about me and I told you about life in Morwood, what itâs been like seeing the sights. You assumed I was lying. Maybe I was. Time, space, realityâ¦ All things I experienced differently from you. We would never have had enough time for me to explain the truths I knew and still know. It did not matter, this was not my story. It was yours.",[152,4508,4509],{},"We talked about your family, about your mother, father, and brother. You told me a bit, though not everything. You were glad to have a chance to speak about it. When the evening had grown long you admitted that you felt as though you were being hunted. That you had been turned into prey for some kind of predator that had decided to toy with you before making the kill. You did not tell me about shooting him, or about failing to burn him. You just said that you were worried. Worried that if you didnât figure out something you would be consumed.",[152,4511,4512],{},"I told you, plainly, that you had to finish the job.",[152,4514,4515],{},"When you woke up the fire had smoldered to embers, and I was gone. I left behind the flask of wine and another gift for you. So you knew I was real, and so you knew how to best handle your phantom.Â ",[152,4517,345],{},[152,4519,4520],{},"Another week passed and you traveled safely. More signs that you were being followed cropped up. Dead animals, notes, splatters of blood. You had grown desensitized to it. It invoked less a sense of terror, and more a grim inevitability. You would find him out there. My words carried with you, and you would finish the job.",[152,4522,4523],{},"You picked a place and began your work. At the farm, hordes of wild boar would occasionally try to make a run on your crops. Fighting them with conventional weapons was impractical. So you would set traps and feast on wild pork. The same principle as now. You would hunt the hunter, or you would die trying.",[152,4525,4526],{},"My gift you placed in pieces against the exterior wall of a rocky tunnel, carved into a cliff face to keep the road going. A handheld device connected to them all, though you set several cables of thin twine to set it off should that fail. You stood at the edge of the overpass, and made certain that the natural lay of the land made it impossible to circumvent without passing through this point. Your enemy did not know you were prepared.Â ",[152,4528,4529],{},"You waited, and kept waiting. So long passed that you began to wonder if he would even come at all. You knew he would, but he always seemed aware of your movements. Maybe he saw this trap coming?",[152,4531,4532],{},"When you were about to pack up and give up, you heard the familiar engine. The bike roared down the road right at you. You stood and held your hands up, a feint of surrender. By the time the man could see your smiling face, it was too late. You pressed the button and threw yourself to the ground as the blast shook everything.Â ",[152,4534,4535],{},"You blacked out briefly and your ears were ringing, but when you came to you saw the tunnel collapsed. You cheered. Though you realized now you had no means of burning the body. You had to burn the body, so you started trying to pull scorched stones off the pile. Maybe the body was destroyed in the blast? Would you be so lucky?Â ",[152,4537,4538],{},"You went back to your horse to grab a tool to dig through the rubble. You were met with another blast and a with a searing pain in your back and stomach. You gawked at the hole in your gut. You tried in vain, and through hideous pain, to put your intestines back in your body. You collapsed to the ground, the blow to your spine left you unable to walk. You spat up blood that filled your mask. You ripped it off and looked around in desperation for the source of your wound. At the edge of the tunnel there was a man, or a creature, half of one. Ichor pooled together into the body of a humanoid, you would not have identified it as the rider were it not for the hat and clothes had had been absorbed into its form.",[152,4540,4541],{},"It held a shotgun that smoked from the blast. It was not human, not any of the other species either. Youâd never seen anything like it. Beige twisted flesh sculpted itself into new life from some kind of liquid slime state. It held the gun with distended, unnatural arms that flared off into tentacles in every direction. Some kind of mutant? A lab subject? You never got to find out.Â ",[152,4543,4544],{},"You crawled toward the crate. Your blood stained the ground beneath you. Your head was light and your heartbeat irregular. You would not survive. You had to know what was in the crate. You had to know what this all was for. You pulled it down and unsealed it. The reassembled man- or rather creature- stood over you. It waited for you to open the box, and it trained the gun on you for a final shot.",[152,4546,4547],{},"Inside the box was the same sterile white. Secured in its center was some kind of book, face bound in ancient leather and marked in a language you couldnât begin to comprehend. Your head was light and your strength failed you. The rider kicked you over, away from the case.Â ",[152,4549,4550],{},"When you come face to face with a monster, it is natural to expect to see cruelty, malice, bloodlust. These things make sense to us. They are impulses that even someone who isnât a monster could feel, given the appropriate context. In this way, we expect monsters to be like us. We make them more human than we have any right to, because we are more comfortable with the things we know.Â ",[152,4552,4553],{},"When you looked into the riderâs gnarled, twisted face. You saw nothing. No hint of desire or want, no hatred for you. It was as empty as the void, and in your final moments that is what scared you the most. When it raised its shotgun and fired a blast that pulverized your skull, it did so without care. It simply did what it was supposed to, like a biological machine.Â ",[152,4555,4556],{},"It did not leave you there to rot. It burned you. Not because it cared about your immortal soul, nor had any sense of justice. It did so because whatever unseen masters that motivated it preferred no evidence of their intervention be left behind. When your body was totally gone, and your soul released, it simply picked up the package, took your horse, and rode away.",{"title":239,"searchDepth":240,"depth":240,"links":4558},[4559],{"id":4219,"depth":240,"text":4224,"children":4560},[4561],{"id":3499,"depth":3347,"text":267},"2023-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","A wasteland journey plagued by a pursuing revenant.

I prayed for myself, too. I beseeched the gods to get me out into the open air again - real air, away from the city and all the bullshit.

Behind, the ritz and glamor of the midtown and uptown rings. In the center of it all, the grand spire that shot all the way into orbit. The smell of chemical exhaust hit my nose. It wasnât my favorite, but at least it felt more honest.Â ",[152,4866,4867],{},"I caught an aircab and considered where to go to find my contact.

They were big, even for a primas-ika. I always wondered if they had gotten muscular-skeletal work done, but it never really felt like my business to ask.

The voices outside were still talking. Too far and too metallic to make out details. It sounded like bursts of radio static in conversation with each other. Three? Yeah, three voices. I stuck my head out very slightly. Nice armor, armed well, and a mounted turret on their truck. Corporate for sure, couldnât make out which one. No way we were taking them.

So, how thoroughly?",[152,6313,6314],{},"I looked at the rest of the tower structure above us. Early Parathan Imperial as best as I could figure. The solid granite building would give way to blends of basalt and decorative marble later in their reign. There were two more floors, partially exposed by a collapse in the structure.

Next, I grabbed a rusted wall sconce and used it to swing up to the protruding lip of a column. Then I leveraged myself into an alcove in the wall, and from there I could reach the second floor. I grabbed it, solid enough on this side. Praise the gods. I wriggled my way up and started helping the others following the same path.

We struggled, I hadnât realized how much I wanted a chance to knock sense into this prissy idiot. I got him in a headlock for a second, he drove an elbow into my gut. Temperance pulled him back.

There was something so beautiful about trees standing so resolute, centuries after they had died. I broke a branch off of one that fell and used it as a walking stick. I looked around. As I suspected, the patrols seemed to stay closer to the estate.Â ",[152,6489,6490],{},"In the ravine was a sealed grate, sure enough. I stopped the other two.

The solution hissed and bubbled, and it was like watching centuries of wear and tear happen in real-time. Strong metal turned to rust, and Temperance gave it a good yank. It ripped a hole into it. The displaced bars rattled on the dusty ground. All of us could fit inside. They beamed, âI thought about putting âdoor-making specialistâ on business cards once.â They gave the âafter youâ gesture with their arms. I went first.Â ",[152,6501,6502],{},"Climbing into any kind of active sewage system was one of the least pleasant things any person could experience.

Our clothes and environmental gear would need triple sanitation when we were done.Â ",[152,6504,6505],{},"I followed Birdieâs map faithfully. These underworks were shared by a few local installations. A right turn would have taken us to a colonial processing center for KAS Extraction, a left too soon or too late would take us to another drainage output on the other side of the plains. I found the correct turn and we wound our way towards the estate.",[152,6507,6508],{},"We found our access ladder. The sewage was less present but wafted down the hall toward us.

Praise be, or whatever.â",[152,6527,6528],{},"He made his way up to the entrance. A single metal door next to a large cargo shutter. There was an intercom and a blood lock.

He waited and internally recited the character profile heâd established.Â ",[152,6530,6531],{},"A womanâs voice came over the doorâs speaker, âThis is private property, state your business.â",[152,6533,6534],{},"He adopted an accent like something heâd heard in the southwest, âGâEvening maâam.

I donât know if my boss would like it if I went all the way back without the job being done!

Thatâs our signal!â We gathered up our things. Rebreathers on, though more for anonymity than breathing safety. I began to climb up the ladder, then Arina, then Temperance.",[152,6562,6563],{},"We reached the hatch. I pushed it open and slid out onto the pavement. When we were all up we closed the hatch. The whole place was surprisingly bright. Sterile white light panels had been installed at the base of the wall, and more hung from the metal framework of the glass roof. We were behind a shed. I peeked around the side. A lush green meditation garden, marked with a spiral pattern of stones toward the center. Birdieâs interior map was accurate. I would have to ask her how she sourced it. Temperance peeked out from behind me. âRather pretty,â they observed.Â ",[152,6565,6566],{},"I ducked back behind the shed. âArtificial. Did you see anyone?â",[152,6568,6569],{},"â2 guards, a custodian, and it looks like a busser from their kitchen.â",[152,6571,6572],{},"âGuardhouse should be to our rightâ¦ follow me.â",[152,6574,6575],{},"We ducked left into the shrubs that bordered the garden. Not too far from it was a pool cleaned by a tread-mobile drone. It paid us no mind. Arina rereleased Dotty and had it fly into an exposed vent. When a guard wandered too close to us, she had it start blaring noises through its loudspeakers. They ran towards the vent, and we slipped past toward another shed. Close to the villa itself now.",[152,6577,6578],{},"One sentry between us and the front door. We could go around back but that would be close to where Dorian was distracting the security chief. The sentry stood in place. Fuck. I felt Temperanceâs long talons on my shoulder.

Spellwork wasnât their forte, or they would have pursued becoming a full-fledged mage. They took a long breath and closed their eyes. They focused on chanting. Drawing on this kind of power took a mix of concentration and the right set of invocations.",[152,6585,6586],{},"Something beyond themself began to push at their mind. The Barrier that all spellcasters must pass. They focused harder and imagined themselves pushing a pin through that Barrier. Power began to seep out, and they grabbed it.",[152,6588,6589],{},"Magic manifested into the Threads of reality. Either modifying them or creating new ones. They focused on the Threads and felt their natural resonance flow around them. The energy flowed into their hands, which began to pulse and glow. Soon, their whole body was enveloped in the shimmering field.Â ",[152,6591,6592],{},"Neither Vulture nor Arina could focus on them. Cloaking spells didnât turn the caster truly invisible but rather bent the Threads around them so that looking at them directly became impossible.Â ",[152,6594,6595],{},"âCan you all see me?â They made a couple of rude gestures and stuck out their tongue. Vulture and Arina shook their heads and averted their gaze out of discomfort. âGood, then grab onto my shoulders!â",[152,6597,6598],{},"The other two complied, though with a bit of extra effort. Soon the shimmering field spread around us as well. Vulture tried to look at Temperance. No luck, like butter sliding on a hot pan. The group turned and started walking. Making a wide U shape around the sentry with their back turned to them. At one point he started turning his head in their direction, but it was like he couldnât completely. He didnât seem to mind.",[152,6600,6601],{},"They made it to the grand natural birchwood double doors. Alice grabbed a doorknob and stared at the metalwork. It looked like Restoration Age craftsmanship. Rich bastard. Vulture tried it. Unlocked. Dumb bastard. It opened inward. She looked inside for any immediate sentries. She made a motion to Temperance and Arina, and let go of the priestâs arm.",[152,6603,6604],{},"It was an open floorplan, very modern. Contrasted by centuries-old decor. Paintings of nobles, and a couple of landscapes. Even some Parathan era swag, like a grand blue vase that had been apparently reassembled with bronze.Â  Temperance looked at Vulture, and saw in her eyes the hungry look of a scavver who was staring at one of the biggest hauls of her life. Then a shake of the head and her focus was back on the job. Temperance appreciated Vulture more than other would-be crew leaders. She had good priorities. This was too clean to risk with extra loot. That was the safe play. Though, maybe if the team got some extra timeâ¦",[152,6606,345],{},[152,6608,6609],{},"I made my way toward the far end of the room, where the sole occupant was dusting some shelves.

I closed the distance quickly. I opened my arms to grab him.Â ",[152,6611,6612],{},"He started turning around.Â ",[152,6614,6615],{},"Fuck. Impulse took over, I swung my metal arm in a punch.

I held out my hand to Arina, âThe mirror you have. Now.â She passed it. Temperance held up his head. I held it under his nose. Still breathing. That was going to need some treatment though. At least-",[152,6620,6621],{},"A rifleâs hammer clicked.Â ",[152,6623,6624],{},"I looked over my shoulder. Arina was holding a gun to a woman in a nightgown. Our intel said his wife was supposed to be in Sidersberg. His wife who was a humanâ¦ This is an elekâ¦ younger tooâ¦ Ah. I stepped forward and tried to reassure her. She shriveled at the sight of blood on my hands. âPlease donât scream.â An empty appeal to a foregone conclusion. She let out a piercing wail.Â ",[152,6626,6627],{},"The gun fired and the woman went to the ground in a seizure. A fake bullet stuck to her and sent an electrical burst through her. Sheâd live but itâd hurt for a while. I nodded to Arina who had a look in her eyes that indicated that was her first time doing that. I tapped her on the shoulder and led us up the stairs. I heard shouts, followed by alarms. The bad outcome. I loaded a stun bolt.Â Â ",[152,6629,6630],{},"Up the stairs. One door guard, armored. He raised a gun. I raised my wrist and ducked. I fired just a second before him. The bolt struck him in the chest and the rifleâs shot went wide. He started convulsing on the ground, but would probably be fine. Probably. I checked behind me. The others had gone to ground. I smirked. We might be able to take this. I tapped my communicator. âD, how are you holding up out there?

I eyed the available furniture for cover. A few tables. Antique wood, but nothing thatâd take a bullet.Â ",[152,6644,6645],{},"âT, got a smoke grenade?âÂ ",[152,6647,6648],{},"They looked at me like I said something dumb.

Letâs go.Â ",[152,6650,6651],{},"I heard a click behind me and the opening of the door behind me. I spun around. The deafening bang of a gunshot. I felt a deep heat in my abdomen.

I crumpled to the ground.Â ",[152,6653,6654],{},"Temperance screamed and rushed towards me. I couldnât think or see straight. It was like I was viewing the events through a few layers of removal. There was an Alice on the ground, bleeding out, but I was watching her from way high up. From the sky. Maybe from the void. I tried to remember the advice I had been given for this back in the service. My mind was too cloudy. From my aerial view, I saw guards swarming our position.

I thrashed weakly, like a caught fish. âHeâs alive.â some distant voice said Then I felt someone grab my jaw and pull my mouth open. More water went down my gullet.Â  Some instinct took over in me and I drank it greedily. There was so much pain in my abdomen. I had never understood why people wanted water when they were dying, but it made more sense now.Â ",[152,6661,6662],{},"My vision returned to me. The two armed men who had been dousing me with a bucket of water left the cell. The cell. I looked around, my vision blurry. Pain too serious to think. The others were there.

I thanked the drone and Arina and Temperance did too. Dotty, and presumably Birdie, gave an affirmative bounce. I peeked my head out into the hallway. One led to another cell. These cells were decently sized. Why did this place have the capacity to hold like 20 people? I shook the thought from my mind. The other way must lead out. I beckoned for the others to follow.",[152,6882,6883],{},"We stayed low and quiet. There was a resograph above us but it seemed powered off. Another gift from Birdie? The hallway turned. This building wasnât big, we had to be nearing an office. I popped my head around the corner. Yeah, an office. Two guards in there. They were armed and armored, and we werenât either. Though we had numbers. I looked at Dotty, not a combat model. I tried to think. What would we do in the service?",[152,6885,6886],{},"Shock and awe.Â ",[152,6888,6889],{},"I explained my plan through a series of complex gestures and whispers.

The knife was still there. Merciful gods.",[152,6891,6892],{},"I started to move forward. Once I was sure they didnât notice us I stood up.

I started stabbing in every weakness in their armor I could find. Several strikes to the neck. Their arm flailed for their pistol, which I wrenched out of their hand.",[152,6897,6898],{},"I didnât think. I just stood back, disengaged the safety, and fired twice in the chest. Blood spattered on the chair, the wall, and the floor, and merged with some of my own on my clothes. Temperance, Arina, and Dorian were beating the shit out of the other one. They turned her in her swivel chair toward me. I gave her one shot to the head.",[152,6900,6901],{},"With both guards in the station dead, we collected ourselves. I tried to clear my mind of what just happened, and my eyes scanned the office. 6 guards in the facility, 6 desks. I looked at the primas-ika, with a special badge on their chest. Security chief. I figured the dead lady was the second in command. Goodâ¦ good. I saw a row of lockers and footlockers. Several bags of items were placed on the ground. Our gear.Â ",[152,6903,6904],{},"We rushed over and reclaimed our things. Dotty was inert, whatever remote control was exerted over it having been released. How Birdie pulled this off at such a range was beyond me. Arina grabbed her slate and regained control of it. Temperance began the rites of the dead for the slain security officers. The stench of burning flesh filled the room and set off the smoke alarms. I opened a locker left open by someone careless. The contents within gave me an idea. âHey, do any of you know how to pick locks?â",[152,6906,6907],{},"Dorian nodded and Arina raised a hand.

Stings though.âÂ ",[152,7042,7043],{},"Temperance set another charge on the door to KanraâLasâ room. It blew open and we charged inside. No one.Â ",[152,7045,7046],{},"âDid he leave?â",[152,7048,7049],{},"Arina adjusted her slate. âDotty still sees the car in the garage. If he did, he didnât go that way.â",[152,7051,7052],{},"I started walking around. I took my helmet off. âIntel says thereâs a panic pod in the room. Start searching the floor and walls.â",[152,7054,7055],{},"We started doing a thorough search of the place. Trying for buttons, levers, and switches. Anything that would reveal a pod an elek could hide in when he got scared. Finally, a decorative wall panel came loose. I ripped at it until it gave way. Then all four of us pulled the pod out. I looked for an opening mechanism. It was tied to a keypad. Fuck.Â ",[152,7057,7058],{},"âDid anybody see a code? This wasnât in the briefing.â",[152,7060,7061],{},"We kept searching the room, except for Dorian. He got out of his riot gear and worked on his gauntlet. âAllow me.â",[152,7063,7064],{},"He took out a set of arcane tools, and began to tinker with the keypad. âI havenât had a chance to actually use this all trip. Itâs what I went to school for, you know.â",[152,7066,7067],{},"It was hard to pretend I wasnât impressed, âEnchanters are something else.â",[152,7069,7070],{},"âI prefer the term arcane engineerâ¦ Got it!â",[152,7072,7073],{},"He stood back, and a spectral image of KanraâLasâ hand appeared and punched in the code. Dorian snapped his fingers and it repeated in a loop. Object memory, I think it was called.",[152,7075,7076],{},"I punched in the code. The pod was unsealed and opened. KanraâLas was inside cowering, protecting his face. âWhatever it is you want, I can pay you!â",[152,7078,7079],{},"âWeâre already getting paid.â",[152,7081,7082],{},"âI can pay you more! Iâm well connected.â",[152,7084,7085],{},"âYou shot me.â I rubbed my abdomen.",[152,7087,7088],{},"He waved his hand. âAnd clearly that didnât stop you! Good for you for rising above such a setback.â",[152,7090,7091],{},"âI think weâre just going to keep robbing you.â",[152,7093,7094],{},"âWait! Wait! Youâve already devastated my property and killed my guards. I-I could hire you on as my new security team! Clearly, youâre better in a fight. Never know when you might need that.â A desperate, nervous laugh.",[152,7096,7097],{},"I looked at Arina, âDoes he need to be awake for this part of the process?â",[152,7099,7100],{},"Arina shrugged and walked over. âNah.â and she punched him out.Â Â ",[152,7102,7103],{},"We lifted his limp body out of the pod and put him face down on the bed. Arina grabbed the rigged memory cartridge and inserted it into a metal port at the base of his brainstem.Â ",[152,7105,7106],{},"While we waited, I pondered exit routes. No real opposition left. Any support they could have called in was still hours away. We could just walk out the front if we really wanted. Arina stood up, sealing the memory cartridge in a protective hard case. âWeâre fucking set!â She cheered, and Temperance joined in. Even Dorian looked a little happy.",[152,7108,7109],{},"My mind went to the fantastic loot that was all over this house. A grin stretched across my face. We were going to get fucking paid.Â ",[147,7111,7113],{"id":7112},"_5-epilogue-scavver","5. Epilogue- Scavver",[152,7115,7116],{},"My radio clock woke me up to the familiar chaos of Dr. Swellâs morning show. I wasnât sure when, and if, he ever slept, honestly. I moaned, rubbed my eyes, and sat up. The side where Iâd been shot ached a bit, and was plenty red still. Probably would be for a long time.",[152,7118,7119],{},"I listened to the radio. Normally, it was music this early, but he had taken a break for a special news bulletin. Something about a group of raiders hitting an estate in corplands and absolutely massacring the inhabitants. Casualties included the entire security team and at least one civilian. He went on to talk about how the government was characterizing the assailants as âchem-addled.â Swell further alleged that this was a false flag operation to further discredit drug use, which the Empire had been working towards recently. He kept going, and I swapped to a folk station.",[152,7121,7122],{},"I remembered what day it was and hopped to my feet. I washed my hair and brushed my teeth. I glanced at my neglected razor and thanked the gods Iâd been able to afford some natural hair removal treatments.Â ",[152,7124,7125],{},"I got dressed and remembered to put my clubwear from last night in my hamper. Temperance, Arina, and I still partied every now and then. Dorian joined us for a night, but no sign of him since. That was okay, I didnât really think we were friends. I was pleased with them all, though. Iâd work with that crew again any day. Maybe no good as thieves, but a fine strike team. A valuable skill, in its own right.",[152,7127,7128],{},"Today, I had a different kind of job. Iâd reached out to Oren, and told him I was getting back in the scavver trade. He told me about a professor at the University who was looking for someone not afraid to deal in Parathan relics. I said I was the girl for the job.Â ",[152,7130,7131],{},"So I got my first contract since my accident a year ago. I stared at my shiny new gear like the hard-won prizes they were. I got suited up. I even got this cool open-visor helmet that was just my shade of purple. It was magnificent, I loved it all so much. I loved what it meant for me even more. I was a scavver again. A real scavver.Â ",[152,7133,7134],{},"I stepped out into the rest of my apartment. Like the rest of The Stacks, it was a modified storage container that Iâd been living out of since I was paying my own rent. I fed the fish, watered the plants, and ate a quick breakfast. I made my way towards the door and remembered something. I stopped at the entryway table and opened a small crate. Inside was another drone, this one orange with olive-green stripes. A gift from my girlfriend.Â ",[152,7136,7137],{},"I picked it up and set it gently in my bag. The front hatch to my place hissed as it unsealed.
